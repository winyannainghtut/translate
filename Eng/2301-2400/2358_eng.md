The elderly man stepped forward and covered a distance of several hundred feet in a flash, instantly arriving before the blood soul.

The blood soul hurriedly shot back in retreat, while the azure-armored puppet pulled back the string of its bow before releasing countless streaks of golden light.

Meanwhile, the black-armored puppet thrust its spear through the air, and a giant blue flower with a diameter of around 10 feet was manifested at the tip of the spear before descending toward the elderly man.

As the flower descended from above, it released a glacial aura, threatening to freeze the space around the elderly man.

At the same time, the streaks of golden light were converging from all directions.

The two puppets were displaying seamless teamwork.

The elderly man harrumphed coldly as a layer of crimson lightning flashed all over his body, tearing the surrounding glacial Qi apart and repelling all of the oncoming streaks of golden light with ease.

He then made a grabbing motion toward the blue flower, and it immediately vanished amid a dull thump, revealing the tip of the blue spear, which the elderly man caught with his bare hand with ease.

The spear-wielding puppet tried to wrench its spear out of the man's grasp, but the weapon refused to budge, as if it had taken root on the man's hand.

Meanwhile, a hint of light flashed through the bow-wielding puppet's eyes, and it began to emit an astonishing aura as it released a long streak of golden light from its bow, which hurtled directly toward the elderly man.

The elderly man chuckled coldly as he opened his mouth to release a ball of crimson lightning, which instantly swelled to the size of a water tank.

The two immediately exploded on contact, and the crimson lighting completely inundated the streak of golden light before surging toward the bow-wielding puppet with unerring accuracy, instantly reducing it to ashes.

At the same time, the spear-wielding puppet was also destroyed by a giant crimson hand that had suddenly appeared out of thin air.

Immediately thereafter, the elderly man appeared right in front of the blood soul before reaching a hand out toward her.

"Hand over your key and treasure, and I'll grant you a quick and painless death. Otherwise, hehe..."

A sinister look appeared on his face as he spoke.

"You were able to enter this place, so you clearly have a key of your own; why are you so intent on taking mine?" the blood soul asked as she retreated with a fearful expression.

"Hmph, do you think I don't know that there are some special places in the Heavenly Cauldron Palace that can only be accessed using the corresponding keys? I only have a replica key, so I naturally have to collect other keys as backups. If you're not willing to hand over your key, then I'll have to take it by force!" the elderly man harrumphed coldly as he made a grabbing motion toward the blood soul.

The gesture seemed to be very ordinary, but the blood soul was struck by the feeling that the entire world around her was locked within the man's grasp, affording her no avenue for evasion.

Right as the elderly man was about to grab onto her shoulder, spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted above her, and a streak of translucent light shot forth toward the elderly man like lightning.

This attack had come without any warning or premonition, and even though the elderly man was a seasoned Grand Ascension Stage being, he was still caught off guard, and it was too late for him to evade.

A dull thump rang out as the streak of light revolved around his outstretched arm was, instantly slicing it into seven or eight sections.

However, the elderly man's body blurred, and he instantly appeared several hundred feet away as he appraised the blood soul with a furious expression.

"Who's there?"

A burst of blood mist sprang erupted out of his wound as he spoke, countless crimson threads writhed and intertwined as a brand new arm quickly took shape.

For a cultivator primarily using a Blood Dao cultivation art, regeneration of dismembered limbs was a simple task.

No one emerged in the wake of the elderly man's enraged cry, but the blood soul's expression had become a lot calmer, and she was continuing to slowly retreat.

The elderly man's expression darkened even further upon seeing this, and he aimed a vicious glare at the blood soul before quickly pointing a finger on his remaining arm toward her.

In the next instant, a rumbling boom rang out around 10 feet in front of the blood soul, and the streak of crimson light reappeared before transforming into a short crimson spear that plunged directly toward her chest.

This sequence of events had taken place in nothing more than the blink of an eye, and it was too late for the blood soul to evade or adopt defensive measures.

Despite her steadfast nature, a hint of panic had crept into her eyes.

Right at this moment, golden light flashed in front of her, and the purplish-golden Jin Tong appeared before waving a hand through the air to swat the crimson spear away.

The elderly man's pupils contracted slightly at the sight of Jin Tong, and a puzzled look appeared on his face.

"Who are you, and how are you related to her?" he asked.

Jin Tong merely appraised the elderly man with a wooden expression, displaying no intention to provide an answer.

It quickly made a grabbing motion with one hand, conjuring up a series of translucent golden threads that formed a giant net, which enshrouded the entire surrounding space.

The elderly man was furious to see this.

"Seeing as you're intent on battling me, then allow me to examine your abilities!"

As soon as his voice trailed off, he made a hand seal, and countless bolts of crimson lightning erupted out of his body.

He then opened his mouth to release an antiquated mirror that was enshrouded within a ball of silver light.

As soon as the mirror appeared, countless silver runes surged out of its surface in a frenzy before transforming into balls of silver lightning.

"Go!" the elderly man yelled before sweeping a sleeve through the air, and the crimson and silver lighting intertwined to form a massive lightning cloud with a diameter of around half a kilometer before surging toward Jin Tong.

Jin Tong remained completely expressionless upon seeing this, and it extended a finger forward, upon which the translucent golden threads instantly shot forth toward the lightning cloud in a torrential barrage.

Bursts of loud crackling rang out within the lightning cloud, and translucent threads instantly punched countless holes into the cloud, causing it to shrink rapidly in size.

The elderly man was completely astonished by what he was seeing. This attack wasn't his ultimate trump card, but it was definitely an ability that he relied heavily upon.

That silver mirror was an incomplete Profound Heavenly Treasure, and in conjunction with his crimson lightning, it had felled countless powerful opponents, yet the attack had been dispelled by his opponent with ease.

What exactly were those translucent threads, and how were they completely unaffected by his lightning?

Right as the elderly man was looking on in a stunned manner, Jin Tong flicked his fingers through the air, and a chill ran down the elderly man's spine as countless streaks of invisible sword Qi appeared out of thin air before surging toward him.

His expression changed drastically as he immediately swept a sleeve through the air, releasing an azure wooden bowl that appeared above him in a flash, then transformed into an azure light barrier that shielded him from all sides.

At the same time, he made a hand seal with his other hand, and a giant crimson wyrm projection emerged behind him.

As soon as the wyrm appeared, it opened its mouth to release a vast expanse of crimson lighting, which swept forth in all directions as a barrier of lightning.

A string of dull thumps rang out as the lightning came into contact with the invisible sword Qi, only to be torn apart like rotten wood.

However, the azure light barrier seemed to possess some type of profound power that allowed it to keep the oncoming sword Qi at bay.

Even so, the elderly man was very alarmed to see this, and his face paled slightly as he hurriedly summoned a strange curved crimson sword out of his storage bracelet.

He immediately grabbed onto the sword before opening his mouth to release several balls of blood essence onto it.

The blood essence was instantly absorbed upon contact, following which the sword suddenly sprang to life, transforming into a crimson snake.

A sinister smile appeared on the elderly man as he hurled the snake forward, and it tumbled through the air before abruptly disappearing on the spot.

In the next instant, a burst of crimson mist suddenly emerged near Jin Tong.

A pair of translucent threads immediately shot out of Jin Tong's eyes to pierce the crimson mist, but it seemed that there was nothing inside it.

Just as Jin Tong was wondering what was happening, the crimson mist suddenly transformed into that snake again before it instantly bit viciously into Jin Tong's shoulder.

The elderly man immediately began to chortle with glee upon seeing this. "Haha, your fate is sealed now! That snake is the Bloodlight Snake, one of the 10 most poisonous snakes on the Blood Sky Continent. Even if you possess an immortal body, you'll be reduced to a puddle of blood within mere moments!"

"Bloodlight Snake? Does it taste good?" Jin Tong finally spoke for the first time as it appraised the snake on its shoulder with a curious expression.

Its voice was very high-pitched, and it struck the listener with a chilling sensation.

The elderly man faltered slightly upon hearing this, and he was then greeted by an astonishing sight.

Jin Tong suddenly grabbed onto the Bloodlight Snake's throat, forcibly tearing the snake off its shoulder, then opened its mouth to bite off the snake's head.
