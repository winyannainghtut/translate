The long-haired man then waved a hand, and the sea beast army immediately continued onward.

Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted nearby, and a translucent thread shot out of thin air without any warning, then instantly reached the long-haired man as if through teleportation before transforming into a streak of translucent sword Qi.

The long-haired man was rather surprised by this attack, but remained calm and opened his mouth to release a ball of purple light, which instantly transformed into a giant shield that was riddled with purple patterns.

At the same time, he made a hand seal, conjuring up a blue water barrier that instantly inundated his entire body.

In the next instant, the translucent sword Qi tore through the giant shield and water barrier like a hot knife through butter, then revolved around the long-haired man's body like lightning, slicing him in half right before his astonished gaze.

The two halves of the long-haired man's body instantly exploded into countless bubbles, and these semi-transparent bubbles shot forth in all directions.

Right at this moment, the translucent sword Qi faded, and a miniature purplish-golden figure appeared before sweeping a finger toward a certain direction, releasing a streak of invisible sword Qi that instantly swept up one of the fleeing bubbles. The bubble immediately transformed into a miniature humanoid figure that was identical to the long-haired man in appearance.

Even though it had several powerful protective treasures to defend itself with, all of them were quickly destroyed by the streak of sword Qi, and the miniature figure was also destroyed amid an anguished howl.

From the instant that the translucent thread appeared to the moment the long-haired man was slain, everything had taken place in the blink of an eye.

The army of sea beasts didn't even get a chance to react, and once they realized what had happened, all of them were naturally extremely enraged.

The dozen or so most powerful sea beasts among them let loose thunderous roars, unleashing all types of attacks that shot forth directly toward Jin Tong in a frenzy.

A cold light flashed through Jin Tong's eyes upon seeing this, and it released countless streaks of invisible sword Qi that rained down from the heavens, destroying all of the oncoming attacks with ease before plunging into the army of sea beasts down below.

Even the average Grand Ascension Stage being wouldn't dare to oppose this sword Qi head-on, so these sea beasts were naturally completely powerless.

Hordes of sea beasts were instantly torn apart by the streaks of sword Qi, and countless severed limbs floated onto the surface of the ocean, which had been stained red by blood.

The sea beasts were finally becoming horrified upon seeing this, and one of them let loose a shrill cry, upon which all of the remaining sea beasts scattered and fled for the lives in all directions.

Meanwhile, Jin Tong looked on from above with a cold expression, then made a grabbing motion toward the ocean down below. The long-haired man's storage bracelet immediately flew out before landing in Jin Tong's grasp, and it took a brief glance at the storage bracelet before vanishing on the spot.

At the same time, blue light within Han Li's eyes faded as he stood at the front of the Inkspirit Holy Ark, and he murmured to himself, "Alright, now that those unwelcome guests have been taken care of, we can wait in peace."

Zhu Guo'er was standing behind Han Li, and judging from her expression, it was clear that she had no idea what had happened.

After that, Han Li closed his eyes to meditate again.

Half a day later, just as the sky was beginning to dim, a talisman suddenly flew out of the sea.

Han Li immediately opened his eyes and made a grabbing motion to draw the talisman into his own grasp.

The talisman then immediately exploded into a crimson fireball, and a stream of information was transmitted into Han Li's spiritual sense, upon which an elated look appeared on his face.

"What is it, Senior Han?" Zhu Guo'er asked in an eager manner.

"They've finally found a place that they suspect to be the entrance. Let's go there right now," Han Li said as he rose to his feet.

Zhu Guo'er was naturally also ecstatic to hear this.

Thus, a black light barrier emerged around the ark at Han Li's behest, and the giant ark slowly descended into the sea.

In a secluded area of the seabed where countless colorful marine plants were growing, there were hundreds of puppets gathered in front of a giant crimson rock.

Patriarch Hua Shi and Tu Yao were standing in front of the puppets, and they were in the process of appraising the crimson rock when the Inkspirit Holy Ark rumbled toward them from the distance like a fiendcelestial.

The ark quickly arrived above the crimson rock, following which Han Li made a hand seal, and the black light barrier around the ark swelled drastically to encompass an area with a radius of several kilometers, forcing back all of the nearby seawater.

"Master Han!"

"Fellow Daoist Han!"

Patriarch Hua Shi and Tu Yao immediately approached Han Li following his arrival. Han Li abruptly vanished from the giant ark before appearing right in front of the giant crimson rock. "This is the place you were referring to in the talisman?"

"That's right. Senior Tu and I have verified our verdict repeatedly, so there should be no mistake. On top of that, we can sense some spatial fluctuations seeping out of this area," Patriarch Hua Shi replied in a respectful manner.

"Fellow Daoist Hua Shi is correct; I'm 80% sure that this is the entrance you're searching for, Brother Han," Tu Yao chimed in in a confident manner.

"Thank you for your hard work, Brother Tu. Guo'er, come over here," Han Li said as he waved a hand toward Zhu Guo'er, who was still on the ark.

Zhu Guo'er hurriedly flew over to Han Li, who instructed, "Come with me and we'll examine to see if this is indeed the entrance to the Small Spirit Sky. If it is, then Hua Shi will also enter with the ark and the puppets."

"Yes, Senior Han."

"As you wish, Master Han."

Zhu Guo'er and Patriarch Hua Shi both gave affirmative responses.

Tu Yao was of the opinion that what Han Li was doing was rather risky, but he then thought back to the astonishing power that Han Li had displayed and decided against trying to dissuade him.

Immediately thereafter, Han Li released a burst of spiritual light that swept up Zhu Guo'er before flying toward the giant rock.

The seemingly ordinary surface of the massive rock warped slightly, and Han Li's duo flew directly into it, leaving Patriarch Hua Shi, Tu Yao, and the puppets waiting for them on the outside.

As soon as Han Li flew into the giant rock with Zhu Guo'er, he immediately decelerated, and his body became very sluggish, as if he had flown into some type of restriction.

At the same time, the spatial fluctuations that had been very faint outside became extremely pronounced here, and there was a ball of rainbow light up ahead that was slowly revolving on the spot.

Han Li directed his spiritual sense into the ball of rainbow light, and his eyes immediately lit up as he transformed into a golden ape that was over 100 feet tall.

Following his transformation, his sluggishness was immediately alleviated, and he grabbed onto Zhu Guo'er before striding toward the ball of rainbow light.

Han Li then plunged headfirst into the ball of rainbow light and vanished on the spot.

In another realm, an earth-shattering boom rang out within a certain forest, and countless beams of golden light suddenly erupted out of a giant lush pine tree.

The tree then shuddered before exploding into countless scraps of wood, leaving a giant crater that was several tens of feet deep on the ground.

Over 100 feet above the crater was a ball of rainbow light that was revolving incessantly, and two people flew out of it amid a burst of spatial fluctuations; they were none other than Han Li and Zhu Guo'er.

Han Li quickly inspected his surroundings, and his brows furrowed slightly as he said, "The spiritual Qi here really is less abundant than that of the Spirit Realm. Guo'er, is this the Small Spirit Sky?"

"Please give me a moment, Senior Han. The density of the spiritual Qi here is very much like that of the Small Spirit Sky, but let me check just to make sure," Zhu Guo'er replied in an excited manner as she also inspected her surroundings.

Immediately thereafter, she flipped a hand over to summon a handkerchief, which she tossed forward before quickly casting several incantation seals into.

A burst of white light flashed over the handkerchief, and an extremely clear map immediately appeared.

Zhu Guo'er was ecstatic to see this, and she said, "My secret technique worked, so this is definitely the Small Spirit Sky! Let me check our current location... We're in the Green Sea of the Small Spirit Sky!"

"It doesn't matter where we are right now as long as this is indeed the Small Spirit Sky. You stay here for now; I'll bring Hua Shi and the others here. The passageway was more difficult than expected to pass through, so Hua Shi won't be able to go through it alone," Han Li instructed.

Zhu Guo'er naturally gave an affirmative response to this.

Thus, Han Li flew back into the ball of rainbow light again, and around 15 minutes later, another burst of spatial fluctuations erupted as the Inkspirit Holy Ark, now shrunk down significantly, flew out of the ball of light.

As soon as the ark emerged, it immediately returned to its original mountainous size, and Han Li and Patriarch Hua Shi were revealed at the front of the ark.

As for Tu Yao and his daughter, they had already departed on the other side of the passageway after extending their gratitude toward Han Li once again.

Zhu Guo'er immediately flew onto the ark with an excited smile, upon which Han Li turned to her, and said, "Alright, tell me about this Green Sea, as well as where you were living in the Small Spirit Sky in the past; I want to have a good chat with your mother."

"The Green Sea is the territory of the Green Spirit Race, which is the most powerful race in the Small Spirit Sky, and also the sworn enemy of our human race. As for the place where I lived in the Small Spirit Sky, that would be the human territory, which is on the other side of the Small Spirit Sky, so it's extremely far away," Zhu Guo'er replied in a slightly dejected manner.
