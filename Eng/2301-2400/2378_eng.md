He immediately swept a sleeve through the air to release a burst of glacial light, which dragged the Ice Phoenix over to his side.

He then opened his mouth to release that translucent bead, transforming into a giant eight-winged centipede before fleeing out of the cave abode as a white thread.

A short while later, the black-robed young man appeared in the distance atop his rainbow cloud.

He appeared to be moving quite slowly, but that wasn't actually the case at all, and he arrived above the mountain after just a few flashes.

He glanced down expressionlessly at the mountain, and a cold smile appeared on his face before he flew away atop the rainbow cloud again, departing in the same direction that the Six-winged Frost Centipede had fled toward.

It seemed that this true immortal really did have a way to track the duo; even after such a long time, he was still able to find their location with unerring accuracy.

Thus, the pursuit continued.

Due to that movement technique being used by the Six-winged Frost Centipede, there was a vast speed disparity, but no matter how much distance was opened up between them, the black-robed young man would always be able to catch up in a few days like a cat toying with a mouse.

The Six-winged Frost Centipede was extremely alarmed by this, but no matter how he examined the Ice Phoenix's and his own body, he couldn't find any tracking marks. Only then did he realize that he had underestimated this true immortal, after all.

As such, he could only continue to expend the Plain Yin Star Qi that he had recently manifested to flee from their pursuer.

Three months later, the Six-winged Frost Centipede was on the verge of collapse, but the black-robed young man suddenly disappeared and didn't reappear for several days.

The Six-winged Frost Centipede and Ice Phoenix were naturally ecstatic to see this, thinking that they had finally shaken off their pursuer. Thus, they hurriedly found a secluded location where the Six-winged Frost Centipede was able to replenish his own energy, but half a month later, the black-robed young man appeared in the nearby area again, and the two of them could only continue their life on the run.

......

In a secluded hall in the headquarters of the He Lian Trade Guild on the Blood Sky Continent, Bi Ying was seated behind a purple wooden table, appraising a jade slip that he had just received with a dark expression.

Moments later, he finished reading the contents of the jade slip before setting it down, then clapped his hands together, and a blurry humanoid figure immediately appeared amid a gentle breeze.

The figure extended a deep bow toward Bi Ying, who asked, "What happened? Why did it take you so long to report Fellow Daoist Yan Yu's death to me?"

"According to our sources, Senior Yan Yu met up with two other Grand Ascension Stage seniors before venturing into the Qi Yun Mountain Range to investigate the disappearance of the eight nations and 19 sects' populations. However, it was only several months later that we received news that they had tracked down the suspected culprit. After that, no further news was received. Thus, we ventured into the Qi Yun Mountain Range with the soul badges of those three seniors, but not long after we entered the mountain range, all three badges shattered in unison.

"Only then did we realize that the three of them had already fallen, but their deaths had somehow been concealed. After investigating for around another month, we finally tracked down the residual auras of the three seniors in a secluded location, and it seemed that a fierce battle had taken place there and that they had all perished at around the same time, but they only seemed to have a single opponent. This is an extremely important matter, so we didn't dare to report back to you until we were sure that our information was correct," the blurry figure explained.

"It's quite incredible that someone was able to repress the reactions of soul badges, even if it's only for a short time. At the very least, I've never heard of something like this in all my years. Fellow Daoist Yan Yu and the others were only considered to be average among Grand Ascension Stage beings, but there are definitely no more than 10 known beings on the Blood Sky Continent capable of killing all three of them at once on their own. Aside from myself, none of the other elders of the guild would've been able to accomplish this. It looks like the culprit behind the blood sacrifice is a truly fearsome being," Bi Ying said with a cold look in his eyes.

"If the culprit had only sacrificed the nations and sects of the Qi Yun Mountain Range, then that would be the end of the matter. With his fearsome might, none of the other powers would be willing to seek revenge against him. However, we've just received news that he appeared again in the Great Dragon Nation around half a month ago and created another boundless river of blood by sacrificing the entire population of that nation. As a result, the Blood Bone Sect and several other major powers were forced to step in."Apparently, these powers have been interacting frequently these past few days, and they seem to be planning to assemble a Devil Slaying Squad of Grand Ascension Stage beings to hunt down this menace. We've also received letters from the involved parties requesting for our trade guild to join them," the blurry figure explained.

"So the Blood Bone Sect and the other super sects are finally willing to step in; it looks like things are truly escalating. Our trade guild will stay out of this matter for now, but we can't just not do anything. I'll get Elder Jun to join this Devil Slaying Squad, but to prioritize his own safety above all else and take care not to directly oppose that menace. Our trade guild has already lost Fellow Daoist Yan Yu, and that's a severe blow," Bi Ying decided.

"Yes, I'll notice Elder Jin Yimeng right away," the blurry figure said with a respectful bow.

"Also, it's almost time for our match against the Infernal Realm, so begin making preparations and summoning our representatives. Hmph, if it weren't for the fact that I have to stay in the guild and prepare for the upcoming match, I would be tempted to see for myself just what kind of menace has sacrificed so many living beings," Bi Ying harrumphed coldly.

"Rest assured, Senior, I'll get everything arranged. Among our representatives, Elder Wen Xinfeng is in this area, and Master Lei has already arrived on the Blood Sky Continent and is in temporary seclusion in one of our trade guild's branches. According to our sources, Senior Han seems to be traveling around the Tidefall Grassland area in search of the ancient altars nearby. The only concern lies with Senior Xue Sha. Ever since he entered the legendary Thousand Steps Maze a year ago, he still hasn't returned; could it be that he's been trapped in there like everyone else?" the blurry figure speculated in a hesitant voice.

"Rest assured, Xue Sha's powers aren't inferior to my own, and with his steadfast nature, there's no way he would've ventured into that maze had he not had full confidence that he would be able to escape from it. Once the agreed time arrives, I'm sure he'll show up," Bi Ying replied.

"In that case, I'll send out messages to Master Lei and Senior Han, then get the members of our branches to arrange their teleportation to the entrance of that small world," the figure said.

"Alright, go ahead," Bi Ying agreed with a slight nod.

Spatial fluctuations erupted in front of the wooden table once again, and the blurry figure vanished after extending a parting bow.

Following his departure, Bi Ying reached out toward a pile of jade slips on the table in an absentminded manner.

However, right at this moment, a dull thump suddenly rang out from within his body, and his expression changed drastically as his outstretched hand stiffened in mid-air.

Only after a long while did he take a deep breath before withdrawing his hand and pressing it against his own waist.

A green jade box immediately flew out amid a burst of green light, then hovered in the air before him.

The surface of the box was riddled with countless spirit patterns, as well as several golden talismans that were flashing with faint spiritual light.

Bi Ying's expression changed slightly as he quickly made a string of hand seals before pointing a finger toward the jade box, upon which the golden talismans were removed at his behest.

The lid of the box also flew up on its own, revealing a strange-looking flat round disk.

The disk was as pristine white as jade with a crimson formation engraved on its surface, at the center of which was a black and white Yin Yang diagram.

The disk seemed to possess some type of mystical property that struck the beholder with a sense of captivation.

Only after appraising the disk for a long while did Bi Ying grit his teeth before reaching into the jade box.

As soon as his finger came into contact with the red formation, it immediately cracked as if it were extremely fragile, and the Yin Yang diagram at its very center completely shattered at the same time.

"I didn't think the legends would ring true. I've been using my blood essence to refine this treasure ever since I reached the Grand Ascension Stage; who would've thought that it would actually display a premonition? Could this have something to do with the upcoming match against the Infernal Realm, or am I about to face another tribulation designed by fate?" Bi Ying murmured to himself as he stared at the round disk with a dark expression.

After a long silence, Bi Ying harrumphed coldly, "Hmph, my life is in my own hands, not in the hands of some predetermined fate. Even if this treasure really is as accurate as the legends suggest, there's still a chance that I could survive. However, I'll definitely have to prepare some more measures in addition to the ones I've already prepared." He then released a burst of green light from the jade box, and the box itself remained unharmed, but the white formation plate within it immediately disintegrated into dust.
