Han Li was naturally oblivious to the scene that had just transpired deep in the underground palace, but after that unsettling feeling disappeared, he was quite relieved.

At this moment, the four of them had emerged from the garden and arrived on an ordinary-looking small plaza.

A massive hall that covered an area of several acres stood directly across on the other side of the plaza, and Lü Shi's brows furrowed slightly as he asked, "Why is my spiritual sense unable to enter that place? Are the restrictions here still activated?"

"It's not the restrictions at work; this hall was constructed from a type of special material from our holy realm. This material is known as Underworld River Sand, and it naturally possesses spiritual sense resistance properties, so it's no surprise that your spiritual sense can't enter the hall," Xie Lian replied with a smile.

Instead of becoming complacent upon hearing Xie Lian's explanation, Lü Shi's brows furrowed even further as he suddenly made a grabbing motion to summon a dagger enshrouded within green Qi. "Hold on, I can sense the aura of stemborers here!"

"Surely not! Could it be that you're mistaken, Fellow Doaist Lü Shi?" Xie Lian's heart jolted upon hearing this, and she also hurriedly summoned three silver rings that appeared before her in a flash of light.

"I've cultivated a special secret technique that allows me to identify the auras of all beings within a radius of several tens of kilometers; I'm certain that there are stemborers nearby!" Lü Shi replied in a confident voice.

Han Li's brows furrowed slightly upon hearing this, and he suddenly rubbed his hands together before raising them toward the hall up ahead.

A pair of loud thunderclaps rang out as two thick bolts of golden lightning sprang forth, transforming into a pair of golden pythons over 100 feet in length before pouncing into the hall.

A rumbling thunderclap immediately rang out within the hall amid flashes of lightning.

"Divine Devilbane Lightning!" Xie Lian's expression changed slightly upon seeing this.

Generally speaking, Divine Devilbane Lightning was no longer all that effective against devilish beings of her caliber, but when unleashed by a fellow Grand Ascension Stage being like Han Li, it would still pose quite a threat to her.

Right at this moment, a string of sharp hissing rang out within the hall, following which five shadowy figures shot out in a flash before landing on the small plaza in a line.

"There really are stemborers here!" Lü Shi's expression immediately darkened at the sight of these figures.

The five figures were none other than five giant human-faced insects. Each of them was around 30 to 40 feet tall with extremely hideous male heads attached to their thin and long necks.

Furthermore, they were holding some crude club-like weapons in their front limbs.

The largest of the human-faced insects was standing at the center, and its exoskeleton was light blue, while the other four all had black exoskeletons, similar to that of the insect carcass Han Li and the others had found earlier.

A sinister look immediately appeared on the blue human-faced insect's face at the sight of Han Li and the others, and it cackled, "Fantastic... There are more foreign beings... We'll be able to have another feast..."

"I really miss the taste of foreign flesh... I can't even remember how long it's been since I last had some..."

Greedy looks also appeared in the eyes of the other human-faced insects.

Xie Lian's expression darkened upon hearing this, and the three silver rings before her began to buzz loudly amid a flash of bright light.

In contrast, Han Li was very relaxed, and after taking a glance at the five human-faced insects, he smiled, and said, "Five is not a disaster, but nothing to be scoffed at either. How about this? Brother Xie and I will take on three of them and leave the other two to you two."

"I certainly have no objections there. You and Fellow Daoist Xie are no ordinary Grand Ascension Stage beings, so we'll be counting on you," Xie Lian chuckled.

Lü Shi naturally had no objections, either, and he slashed his dagger through the air, releasing a burst of green Qi that transformed into a wyrm, which pounced directly toward one of the human-faced insects.

The human-faced stemborer was completely unfazed, and opened its mouth to expel a burst of grey Qi.

The two clashed amid a resounding boom, then rose up into the heavens like a pair of wyrms that were constantly tearing at one another.

Immediately thereafter, the three silver rings in front of Xie Lian disappeared in a flash, and in the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted above another one of the human-faced stemborers, following which the three silver rings reappeared before crashing down with ferocious might.

A ferocious look appeared on the human-faced stemborer's face, and it swung its two thick clubs violently upward, sending two bursts of enormous power crashing into the three silver rings.

The three rings tremored violently, and were unable to continue in their descent.

The blue human-faced stemborer cackled upon seeing this, then sprang forward using its hind legs, upon which it suddenly vanished into thin air.

"Leave that thing to me," Daoist Xie said as he also disappeared amid a flash of silver lightning.

In the next instant, a dull thunderclap erupted up above, and Daoist Xie and the giant blue stemborer appeared in the sky in unison amid a violent explosion.

Daoist Xie immediately made a grabbing motion, and arcs of silver lightning converged to form a pair of giant shimmering silver blades, following which his body swelled to over 100 feet in size, and he charged toward the giant stemborer as he brought his blades down with vicious force.

The blue stemborer let loose a loud screech as it also swelled several times in size, swinging its giant clubs through the air in retaliation without any fear in its eyes.

A string of earth-shattering booms rang out as the two clashed with their weapons over and over again.

Daoist Xie remained completely expressionless, and his silver blades were revolving around the blue stemborer while unleashing ferocious attacks like a pair of silver wheels.

Meanwhile, the blue stemborer was cackling incessantly, and it had a near-deranged look on its hideous face as its massive black clubs were revolved around its body as bursts of black Qi.

The two of them seemed to be evenly-matched.

Right at this moment, a giant green flower projection appeared behind Xie Lian, and it immediately transformed into countless azure saber projections that swept toward the giant stemborer up ahead.

Meanwhile, Lü Shi had produced a huge shimmering golden seal, which instantly swelled to a size of a mountain at his behest before slamming down onto his opponent over and over again.

The human-faced stemborers possessed very powerful bodies, but even they didn't dare to take such astonishing attacks head-on, and could only take evasive measures.

Seeing as three of the human-faced stemborers had been occupied, Han Li cast his gaze toward the two remaining giant insects.

Those two stemborers were currently hesitating about whether they should reinforce their companions or deal with the only available enemy.

A faint smile appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and he made a hand seal, following which countless golden runes surged out of his body.

A loud thunderclap rang out, and those runes instantly transformed into scintillating bolts of golden lightning that enshrouded his entire body.

He then made a hand seal followed by a grabbing motion, and the bolts of lightning converged to form a shimmering golden ball of lightning that gave off an extremely formidable aura.

The two human-faced stemborers immediately sensed the threat being posed by Han Li, and they hissed in unison as they rushed directly toward Han Li, leaving trails of afterimages in their wake.

One of them opened its massive mouth, releasing a burst of nauseating black liquid, while the other hurled its giant clubs directly toward Han Li.

Han Li raised an eyebrow upon seeing this, and he suddenly disintegrated into specks of spiritual light.

As a result, the giant clubs and black liquid all missed their target.

The two giant stemborers were very alert, and they immediately flapped their wings upon seeing this, upon which they also instantly disappeared.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted on either side of the plaza, and the two giant stemborers re-emerged.

However, the specks of spiritual light suddenly converged to form Han Li's body once again, standing on the exact same spot as before.

It turned out that Han Li had never actually left that spot; he had easily managed to fool the two stemborers with an illusion.

The two stemborers' hearts jolted upon seeing this, and they immediately pounced toward Han Li again, but it was already too late.

Right at this moment, Han Li gently tossed the ball of lightning in his hands up into the air, and it vanished into thin air amid a flash of golden light, following which an earth-shattering burst of rumbling immediately rang out.

Countless golden runes scattered through the air, following which a bolt of golden lightning as thick as a water tank came crashing down upon a human-faced stemborer with unerring accuracy.

This was none other than the complete Lightningwield Technique that Han Li had only recently mastered!

A howl of anguish rang out, and the stemborer didn't even get a chance to struggle before it was wiped out of existence by the golden lightning.

The Lightningwield Technique was so formidable that even a human-faced stemborer couldn't take a single attack!

The other giant stemborer was both shocked and enraged to see this, and it abruptly let loose a piercing screech, unleashing a burst of invisible soundwaves that swept directly toward Han Li.
