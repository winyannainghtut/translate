Chapter 421: Spirit Sealing Pillar

In the distant sky at an unknown time, a huge cloud of insects spanning over a hundred meters had appeared, staining that part of the sky gold and silver . The huge buzzing seemed to be coming from this new cloud of insects .

Underneath the insect cloud, Han Li looked at the eccentric with a gaze as if he were looking at a corpse . He commanded, “Go!”

Suddenly, the huge insect cloud flew towards the eccentric as an overbearing sky-shrouding shadow .

The eccentric’s limbs grew ice-cold . This insect cloud was over ten times larger than the previous . It wasn’t something he could withstand . In his terror, he felt a sudden desire to flee .

With an unsightly expression, he recalled his transformed flower basket . He then struck his two ghost heads with blood-red magic seals, and began to chant a cryptic incantation . As for the weapons that were disabled and had been held within the white mist, they were tossed away without hesitation .

The eccentric’s decisiveness surprised Han Li .

The two ghost heads madly spat out several more wisps of flames as they retreated, but Han Li wasn’t about to let them slip away so easily .

Under his command, the huge insect cloud thoroughly drowned the ghost heads and their flames in an instant . The flames were cleanly consumed by the several tens of thousands of Gold Devouring Beetles in an instant, and the ghost heads’ themselves were filled with countless Gold Devouring Beetles .

With this, Han Li knew that the skulls were already finished . But just as he wanted to collect the Gold Devouring Beetles and go chase after the eccentric, he heard two enormous explosions .

The two ghost heads had self detonated in twin blazes of green flame, engulfing a large portion of the Gold Devouring Beetles . Han Li was initially left reeling by the scene but that soon disappeared .

From his mental connection, apart from the several hundred closest to the heart of the explosion, a vast majority of his Gold Devouring Beetles were unscathed .

It seemed that these immature Gold Devouring Beetles were not invulnerable . After a certain limit, they were still capable of being destroyed .

However, their sturdiness was already much to Han Li’s satisfaction . After all, the Gold Devouring Beetles only suffered damage from the extremely powerful detonation of the ghost heads . He was confident that any common Core Formation cultivator wouldn’t stand a chance against these insects .

With that thought, Han Li wordlessly turned into an azure streak and collected his Gold Devouring Beetles before chasing after the eccentric .

Han Li’s thoughts were quite simple . Since deep hatred was planted between him and the eccentric, it was naturally better to settle this problem once and for all . Not wanting to leave a potential enemy, he couldn’t allow him to easily escape .

A second later, Crooked Soul joined him and flew next to Han Li as a streak of yellow light, joining in the pursuit .

As for the others, they glanced at each other while staying in their original places . It seemed that for the time being, they were incapable of believing that Han Li had single-handedly forced the eccentric to flee .

The eccentric’s escape method was quite impressive . Even when using the entirety of his strength to propel his green brilliance dagger, the distance between them was only gradually increasing . In the blink of an eye, the three had traveled over twenty kilometers and were about to leave the scope of the barren island .

Seeing this, Han Li’s eyes glinted with cold light . After taking a deep breath, seven palm-sized emerald green swords suddenly shot from his body .

After flying a circle around his body, the small swords merged into a huge green sword . With a blur, Han Li and Crooked Soul arrived on the huge sword . It then flashed with green radiance and cut through the sky as an emerald streak of light that was nearly forty meters long, increasing their speed by nearly fifty percent .

After the time it took to make a cup of tea, Han Li had caught up to the eccentric . After seeing the black light that was singularly focused on flying, Han Li waved his arm with an icy expression . Two small emerald swords shot towards it along with Crooked Soul’s Immemorial Bowl .

The escaping eccentric had clearly seen that his relentless pursuers had released their magic treasures towards him . He immediately responded by throwing a skull towards them . Afterwards, the eccentric continued flying without looking black .

According to the eccentric’s thoughts, the skull should be able to buy him some precious time at the very least .

Han Li’s expression darkened, and he silently cast an incantation gesture . His two flying swords then flashed with green light and turned into four swordlights which were indistinguishable from one another . Two of these swordlights and the immemorial bowl flew straight towards the skull while the other two swordlights combined to form a foot-long flying sword . It rushed past the skull and shot towards the back of the eccentric without a sound .

The flying sword became much faster after combining together and arrived behind the eccentric in the blink of an eye .

However, the eccentric felt that something was amiss and turned his head, discovering an emerald streak of light that was only fifteen meters away from him .

The eccentric’s face turned deathly pale . Responding quickly to the emergency, he opened his mouth and spewed a puff of black Qi towards the flying sword . Afterwards, he hastily flew away, wanting to escape .

Under Han Li’s command, the flying sword continued straight through the black Qi without any hesitation . As it approached, an arc of faint golden lightning struck the black Qi and thoroughly blew it away, leaving the flying sword completely unobstructed .

Then with a flash of green light, the emerald flying sword pierced through the eccentric .

The eccentric looked down at the flying sword in his chest with an expression of complete disbelief . Without the chance to say a single word, he was struck with faint golden lightning and turned to ash .

Han Li hastily approached . After blurring a few times, he reappeared with three items in his hands and focused his attention on them . Apart from the flower basket ancient antiquity, there was also a storage pouch and a scroll painting sparkling with red light . From paintings stealthily contained Spiritual Qi, even if it wasn’t a desolate antiquity, it was still undoubtedly an unordinary magic treasure .

Delighted, Han Li gently unrolled the scroll and was soon stunned .

After staring at the scroll for a long while, Han Li slowly rolled it back up and wore a contemplative expression . Forcefully suppressing the suspicions he had in mind, Han Li flew towards the skull in silence .

Now lacking a master, the black skull floated in the air without movement . Although it still retained a trace of its evil Qi, it now completely lacked any trace of its former intelligence .

After taking a look, Han Li slightly frowned . In truth, this was the first time he had seen an item like this . He faintly felt that this item definitely had a bad history, but he still felt reluctant to just let it go . After a moment of hesitation, he decided to store it in a jade box .

After circling around the area once more, Han Li flew back with Crooked Soul . On the way, he encountered Jin Qing and the others who on their way to assist him .

Having seen Han Li and Crooked Soul return completely unharmed, they crowded around him in pleasant surprise .

“Fellow Daoist Han, what happened to that eccentric? Did he escape?” Jin Qing couldn’t help but ask .

“He died by my hand!” Han Li calmly said .

“He’s dead? That’s great . From his profuse, evil Qi, we would have definitely found ourselves hopelessly entangled if he decided to pursue us in the future . That would’ve proved to be extremely troublesome . ” Jin Qing replied with a large breath of relief .

With slightly changed expressions, the nearby Hu Yue and cultivator Jian looked at Han Li with gazes of involuntary respect .

After all, one’s capability defined one’s status in the cultivation world .

Afterwards, the party returned to their original location where Fairy Shi was worriedly waiting for them .

The group gathered together once more . After some discussion, Han Li felt that it would be best to quickly break through the formation in order to prevent any further unexpected incidents from occurring .

Thus, the group once again got into formation . After refocusing his heart, Han Li placed down the formation flags and plates .

The destruction of the last restriction was exceptionally smooth . After the scarlet light barrier was destroyed, the “Winged Fiends” contained within were cleanly eliminated by their water attribute magic tools .

The party revealed joy and soon turned their gazes towards the strange, exposed stone pillar at the center .

With no restrictions in the way, the group was clearly able to see the stone pillar with their spiritual sense and eyesight .

The stone pillar’s talisman markings were extremely strange . The pillar was covered in eight huge ancient talisman scripts that spiralled around it from top to bottom along with countless strange stripes . In addition, the stone pillar was embedded with extremely rare Yin-Yang Jade in an even distribution . They occasionally flashed with dim black and white lights .

After looking at this for some time, they looked at each other in confusion and sunk into contemplation, bitterly attempting to recall any relatable information .

“Spirit Sealing Pillar!” After a short moment, the weakest among them, Shi Die, suddenly shouted out the name of the stone pillar in alarm .

The others were stunned upon hearing this, but they soon looked at each other in bewilderment .

“Fairy Shi, are you certain? Is this really a Spirit Sealing Pillar?” Hu Yue couldn’t help but ask with doubt .

“Absolutely! I possess a book of ancient formation spells that particularly mentions the Spirit Sealing Pillar . From its appearance and those talisman markings, it is exactly as was described in the book . Don’t be fooled into believing it to be some common stone pillar . It was forged from over ten extremely precious tool refinement materials . This lone pillar is worth about six thousand spirit stones . ” Shi Die gazed at this pillar with excitement .
