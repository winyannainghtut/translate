Chapter 475: Wolf Head Puppets

Currently, Han Li and the others were walking through a maze-like series of intersecting stone passageways . Each intersection had a stone gate inscribed with strange talisman characters .

These stone gates were identical in size . They were over thirty meters wide and were in the shape of a square . They would always point in the direction of north, south, east, or west seemingly at random . However, they all shined with a faint white light . They were clearly affected by some sort of restriction .

Although he would only encounter a crossroads after a long distance, Han Li reckoned that during their entire time in the Inner Halls, they’ve already encountered at least eight stone gates . Each time, they neither changed direction or entered the stone gates .

They eventually arrived at an intersection that made Han Li’s expression stir .

The gate there slightly differed from the others ones . Although its talisman characters and structure was the same, it was completely lightless as if the restriction on it had been extinguished . As a result, Han Li further looked at it with a strange expression .

Wu Chou saw Han Li’s expression and spoke to him with a familiar tone, “Junior Martial Brother Han, this stone gate had already had its treasure seized by others . What is worth seeing? If it weren’t for the fact that each person could only use a single Heavenvoid map fragment before being teleported out, I would’ve also thought to pick a stone gate and hastily see what was within . Once a Heavenvoid Map fragment was used to open a stone gate, one would be unable to leave until the treasure was acquired . As Core Formation cultivators we will only be able to acquire treasures on the first floor . Picking a room on the later floors would nearly be the same as suicide . ”

‘Junior Martial Brother Han?’ When Han Li heard Wu Chou address him as such in a voice transmission, he felt disgust spread throughout his body .

When Han Li eventually managed to recollect himself, he replied with a beaming smile, “Then why isn’t Brother Wu choosing a gate on the first floor? Would it not be a waste of an opportunity to wait until you’ve arrived to the second floor or higher?”

“Sigh! I wish I could, but my esteemed grandfather had repeatedly warned me that I must stay by his side on this treasure hunt as I may prove useful . ” Wu Chou wore a reluctant expression as he glanced at the stone gate . A trace of greed flickered from his eyes .

Han Li slightly smiled and swept his gaze at the stone gate . So long as he entered and acquired the treasure it contained, he would be teleported outside . He would be keeping this in mind . Who knew whether or not he could use this as a method of escape?

At that moment, the group passed through another intersection and into the passage ahead of them . But at that moment, a heavy, muffled thud came from their front . The sound continued as if something huge was slowly heading towards them .

Zenith Yin and Qing Yi’s expressions slightly changed and they halted, staring into the passageway ahead of them with grave expressions . In contaste, Man Huzi chuckled and revealed a trace of excitement . At the same time, his body flashed with golden light and a layer of golden scales suddenly covered his entire body . He had activated his Heavenbearing Devil Arts .

This was the first time Han Li saw the bizarre appearance of the Heavenbearing Devil Arts up close . He couldn’t help but take a curious stare at Man Huzi’s transformation .

Man Huzi keenly felt Han Li’s stare and turned his head around, giving Han Li’s sinister grin . The face covered in small scales made for a frightening sight .

Han Li’s heart dropped, not knowing what he had meant by it . But still, he forced himself to return the smile .

Fortunately, after Man Huzi smiled, he immediately turned his gaze back .

The approaching thuds were now only about a hundred meters away .

But as the passage across from them was pitch-black, Han Li wasn’t able to see within it . There were still restrictions inside the Inner Hall that restrained a cultivator’s spiritual sense .

Still, Han Li noticed the cold glint from the old eccentrics’ eyes . It seemed they were able see what it was .

Without waiting for Zenith Yin and Qing Yi to act, Man Huzi deeply roared, flying into the passage as a streak of golden light . A series of loud impacts followed afterwards along with deafening clangs of metal .

When Zenith Yin and Qing Yi saw this, they couldn’t help but look each other in dismay .

Han Li was at a loss when a huge rumble sounded out as if something had been cleanly split into fragments .

Han Li’s mind stirred and something came to mind .

In the next moment, only the sounds of Man Huzi’s wild, carefree laughter could be heard .

Zenith Yin seemed to have thought of something and couldn’t help but laugh . “Let’s go! It is no longer a problem . We’ve already forgotten that we no longer have the same cultivation as we did three hundred years ago . The guards on the first layer are no longer a threat to us . ”

Qing Yi chuckled with a relaxed expression, “That’s right . This old man had nearly forgotten this as well . The last time I came, I had just entered Nascent Soul stage, and the guards had left far too deep an impression . It was good that Brother Man had taken care of it with his Heavenbearing Devil Arts . Else, we would’ve spent too much effort on them . ”

Afterwards, the two began to take the lead with Han Li and Wu Chou closely following after them . The Bone Sage, who had originally been expressionless this entire time, wore a trace of disdain as he calmly followed them in the back .

After walking about thirty meters, Han Li saw Man Huzi in front of them with his hands behind his back . He was standing on something that was shining with silver light .

When Man Huzi saw Zenith Yin, he stretched his neck and indifferently said, “Not bad! This served quite well for a warm up . The Heavenvoid Hall this time around is truly interesting . However, it wasn’t nearly as formidable as rumors had it!”

“It was because of the incredible force of Brother Man’s Heavenbearing Devil Arts . Other cultivators used magic treasures in such a narrow area, so they had experienced a bit of trouble . ” Layman Qing Yi said with a smile . When Man Huzi heard his flattery, he chucked but said no more . The golden scales on his body quickly faded away, and he indifferently took the way . It seemed the previous fight had left him unsatisfied .

Zenith Yin and Qing Yi glanced at each other with a smile . Since Man Huzi was so willing to lead the way, they were more than willing to quietly follow after him .

When they walked past the silver item, Han Li stopped and lowered his head to look at the item .

‘A mechanical puppet!’ Han Li was astounded . It was indeed a puppet, but what grade of puppet was this to have not been instantly destroyed by a mid Nascent Soul stage cultivator?

Most of what was scattered across the ground were pieces of an unknown silver metal . Apart from this, there was a ruined half of a gold wolve’s head, several pieces of jet-black, thick and reflectioness blades, as well as an assortment of several other oddities .

As the Bone Sage quickly passed him by, he indifferently said without turning his head, “Don’t bother to look at them . While these items are certainly rare, they cannot be used to refine any magic treasures . Those long before have already tried . ”

Han Li was surprised by this, but he continued to look at the ground as if he hadn’t heard . His gaze fell upon sparkling, dark-green gem on the ground . Its extremely cold aura gave Han Li a remarkable impression .

After muttering to himself for a moment, Han Li immediately placed these items into his storage pouch with a sweep of his hand before rejoining the others .

Han Li’s thoughts were quite simple . Even if these items were truly useless, he could learn a bit about the ancient cultivator’s achievements in puppet techniques from the puppet’s composition and refinement techniques . After all, the highest grade puppets in his Puppet Sutra were grade four puppets, equivalent to only late Foundation Establishment cultivators at false core stage . It was a puppet he had seen before, the huge tiger that consumed an entire mid-grade spirit stone with a full powered strike . 1

The puppet with the golden wolf head was stronger than an early Core Formation cultivator . Although Man Huzi dealt with it like child’s play without using any powerful magic treasures, Zenith Yin’s and Layman Qing Yi’s serious attitude towards indicated that it was unordinary .

With such good items in hand, it was only natural for Han Li to want to leave and research it . But as things stood, there would be no such opportunity for him to slip away a stone gate and escape with treasure as well . He understood all too well that despite walking ahead of him, the three Nascent Soul eccentrics were watching his every move through their spiritual sense . Wanting to stealthily slip away through a stone gate was merely wishful thinking .

With Han Li’s temperament, it felt somewhat intolerable to leave empty handed from a treasure trove such as this . For now, he could view these puppet fragments as a consolation prize from the Inner Halls . As for the treasures of the Heavenvoid Cauldron, Han Li knew better than to have such fanciful expectations!
