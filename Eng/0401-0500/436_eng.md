Chapter 436: Another Encounter with Fairy Violet Spirit

Without even the slightest deliberation, Han Li was completely certain that what the Bone Sage had said was true .

After all, for the Star Palace to tower over the Scattered Seas for so many years, they must’ve resorted to using at least a few tricks . They certainly hadn’t come to supervise the Heavenvoid Hall today for an empty reason . They most likely held their own plans .

With that thought, Han Li’s eyes coldly glinted . Although he didn’t reply to the Bone Sage, he immediately became increasingly vigilant of the two white-clothed elders .

In the following moments, the two white-clothed old men sat still and sank into a state of Qi Refinement . Their eyes remained closed, and they didn’t speak another word .

This strange atmosphere continued for three days . However, only four new cultivators arrived during that time . None of them were Nascent Soul cultivators .

Then, a sudden change occurred on the morning of the fourth day . A series of booms echoed throughout the hall . Without any warning, a white jade stone door descended, sealing off the entire hall .

The gate was covered in a layer of white mist, an obvious indication of its formidable restrictions . Soon, there was a faint boom of palace gates closing from a distance far away .

A few cultivators in the hall couldn’t help but express alarm . But after discovering that the Nascent Soul cultivators appeared calm, they felt relieved .

At that moment, the two white-clothed elders from the Star Palace calmly opened their eyes and stood up .

Suddenly, the other cultivators in the hall gazed at them with either confusion or realization . As for the Nascent Soul cultivators, they expressionlessly gazed at the two’s actions in silence .

The two calmly calmly walked towards the front of the hall .

But before they arrived, the end of the hall lightly trembled to soon reveal several stone slabs releasing a dazzling white radiance . Under everyone’s amazed gazes, a three meter wide transportation formation had suddenly appeared .

Those among the many cultivators that had yet to see a transportation formation were awed at its appearance, leaving many arrogant cultivators in amazement .

The two white-clothed elders walked to the front of the transportation formation and bowed over it before carefully examining it .

A while later, the two glanced at each other and nodded .

“Alright, there are no problems with this transportation formation . You will arrive at the outer halls of the Heavenvoid Halls through this . Conduct yourselves well . ” With that said, the white-clothed old men stepped into the transportation formation . With two flashes of white light, they disappeared without a trace .

Afterwards, the other cultivators in the hall unconsciously looked at each other in dismay .

But without waiting to see anyones reaction, Wan Tianming dropped down from the jade pillar with the old Daoist and the dark, thin old man, walking into the transportation formation without hesitation, disappearing with three flashes of white light .

By the time the others reacted, those that were relatively closeby rushed forwards .

Suddenly, the transportation formation started flashing without end . In the blink of an eye, nearly half of the cultivators in the hall had disappeared . The Sage of Bones suddenly stepped forward from the crowd .

Han Li’s eyes flashed with a strange expression . He unconsciously turned his gaze towards Grandmaster Zenith Yin to discover that Grandmaster Zenith Yin was looking at him with an unknown intent . Greatly frightened, Han Li hastily turned his gaze way with great unrest in his heart .

It seemed that Grandmaster Zenith Yin wasn’t about to let him go!

In his gloom, Han Li bluntly stood up and walked forward .

When Grandmaster Zenith Yin saw Han Li’s actions, his mouth formed a strange sneer . This caused the nearby Wu Chou to break his silence, unable to restrain himself from asking, “Venerable Ancestor, you seemed to be greatly interested in that youngster . Is there something strange about him?”

Wu Chou felt truly curious .

“That person will prove extremely useful to me . I merely require a bit of his aid . ” Grandmaster Zenith Yin shook his head and spoke indifferently as if he was unwilling to inform Wu Chou .

Wu Chou, who had always received Zenith Yin’s favor, felt quite puzzled .

At that moment, the Confucian-robed “Layman Qing Yi” lightly coughed and slowly said, “We should set off . There aren’t many people left in the hall . ”

Zenith Yin paused for a moment before sweeping his gaze past the few cultivators left in the hall . He replied with a faint smile, “Naturally . If we don’t leave soon, the transportation formation will disappear . It will only reappear again a month from now . ”

With that said, Zenith Yin turned into a black cloud and carried off Wu Chou with him .

When Layman Qing Yi and Man Huzi saw this, they leisurely flew off the jade pillar .

As for the beautiful woman, she had already jumped off . It appeared that she had no intention of mingling among their group . ……

Once Han Li entered the transportation formation, he immediately appeared above a small, barren hill . After looking around, he couldn’t help but be amazed . He only saw two men and woman not far away from him . There was no trace of any of the other cultivators .

When the female cultivator caught sight of Han Li, she revealed pleasant surprise .

Fairy Violet Spirit walked over to Han Li with a beaming smile . The male cultivator she was travelling with was transported to an unknown location . Han Li couldn’t help but bitterly laugh at his terrible luck for having trouble placed on him .

As for the other two, one was a grey-clothed old man while the other was a masked man covered in black robes .

The old man plainly stood by while a dark green mist spiralled around the black-robed man’s body . It appeared the masked man was a Devil Dao cultivator . The two stood apart as if they found each other unpleasant to the eye .

Fairy Violet Spirit was now walking towards Han Li . This naturally aroused the two’s attention and they couldn’t help but size up Han Li .

The old man’s gaze was friendly and he gave Han Li a kind smile . As for the black-robed man, his gaze was ice-cold and didn’t hold the slightest emotion .

Han Li calmly returned their gaze without the slightest change in expression .

At that moment, Fairy Violet Spirit had already arrived in front of Han Li . She said with a slight smile, “I didn’t expect to arrive together with Senior Han . It seems I will have to trouble Elder Han to watch over me for a bit . Otherwise, it would prove quite difficult for me to pass through this trial by myself . ”

With that said, Fairy Violet Spirit closed her lips, appearing somewhat embarrassed .

Han Li frowned and didn’t immediately reply . After a moment of thought, he doubtfully asked, “Lady Violet Spirit’s cultivation has made great strides . Congratulations on reaching late Foundation Establishment . But why has Fellow Daoist Violet Spirit come to this place? This place is truly dangerous . After all, even Core Formation cultivators would find it difficult to survive in the Heavenvoid Hall . ” Although Han Li had only an inkling of knowledge about the Heavenvoid Halls, he understood the severity of the dangers that lay within .

After hearing Han Li’s question, Fairy Violet Spirit’s beautiful face revealed a trace of bitterness . With a helpless tone, she said, “This woman also didn’t wish to come here . But as you see, I am currently in False Core Stage, and I want to attempt Core Formation as soon as possible . However, my own aptitude is poor . The supplementary medicine pills I was able to gather together are pathetically few . In fact, I had to pay a great price to purchase a Heavenvoid map fragment from someone else, so I could come here to test my luck . After all, I’ve heard that spiritual medicines are abundant in the Heavenvoid Hall . Perhaps the Heavens would watch over me and have me run across some spiritual medicines that hold great effects towards Core Formation . Besides, I’ve already made up my mind to only attempt this first trial! I will not attempt to go through with the second!”

Fairy Violent Spirit’s expression then grew dim, appearing to be in low spirits .

Han Li inwardly sighed and grew silent .

Had he not practiced the “Three Essence Revolutions Technique” and the “Great Development Technique” and possessed so many medicine pills that forcefully raised his odds of Core Formation, he suspected his own chances at Core Formation would’ve been even lower than Fairy Violet Spirit’s . With that thought, Han Li developed a feeling of empathy towards this fellow sufferer .

After some further thought, his Heaven Lightning Bamboo had come from her despite the conditions and her Exquisite Sound Sect does send him a certain amount of spirit stones every year . Although it wasn’t much, he does owe her a favor . It would be best to take advantage of this situation to repay it!

With that in mind, Han Li’s expression relaxed, and he said with an indifferent tone, “Since I can travel together with Fellow Daoist Violet Spirit, I can afford to offer some care . However, if I were to truly run into a helpless situation, Fairy Violet Spirit had best come up with her own plans for escape . ”

“Many thanks to Elder Han . Violet Spirit naturally understands how things stand . I definitely won’t slow down Elder Han . ” Upon seeing Han Li agree, Fairy Violet Spirit’s soft beauty flourished and her eyes became radiant, stunning Han Li .

Soon after, Han Li realized he had lost his self-control and hurriedly turned his head away . With a hot face, he didn’t dare to further look at her .
