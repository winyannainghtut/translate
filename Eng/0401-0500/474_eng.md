Chapter 474: The Mantis and the Oriole 1

When Zenith Yin heard Wan Tianming call his words nonsense, a sinister expression appeared on his face, but after hearing what Wan Tianming said after, he forcefully suppressed his fury . He then turned his head to Man Huzi and Layman Qi, and spoke to them in voice transmission .

Not longer after, their discussion was finished . Zenith Yin coldly said, “As per your esteemed suggestion, we will cease fighting for now . We will wait until after the treasure is seized . ”

Wan Tianming chuckled, “Good! You’ve made a wise decision . Let us enter together . ” He then walked towards the huge limestone gate with Tian Wuzi and the old farmer closely following after him .

“Humph!” Man Huzi couldn’t help but snort at their grandiose mannerisms . His gaze then suddenly swept to Yuan Yao and the Core Formation cultivator that Han Li didn’t recognize with an ominous glint in his eyes .

At that same moment, the two paled at having became aware of Man Huzi’s malicious appearance . They both turned into a streak of yellow and red light, rushing towards the stone pagoda .

Man Huzi evilly grinned, “Where do you two think you’re going?”

He rubbed his hands and then waved them, shooting out two streaks of gold light in an instant, striking at them from behind .

The male cultivator in the yellow light released a miserable shriek before he tumbled to the ground . He was then swept up by the golden light and was split apart, scattering across the ground as a dismembered corpse .

As for when the golden light neared Yuan Yao’s red light, several bursts of blinding green flames temporarily scattered the golden light . As if spurred on by this, her red light transformed into a scarlet-red bird and became even faster . Shooting past the golden light in a blur, she entered the stone pagoda’s entrance and disappeared .

“Yi! That’s odd . ” Layman Qing Yi softly said with a frown .

Layman Qing Yi and Zenith Yin didn’t mind Man Huzi’s actions, but upon seeing Yuan Yao escape Man Huzi’s attack, they couldn’t help but be surprised .

“Man Huzi, what is the meaning of this? Why did you attack the innocent?” Tian Wuzi turned around and spoke with an angry expression .

Man Huzi gave an uncaring glance at the old Daoist and callously said, “I wasn’t in a good mood . What does it matter to you if I kill a few strangers? Could it be that you wish to take justice on their behalf or do you just wish to personally test my Heavenbearing Devil Arts?”

“You…”

Without turning his head, Wan Tianming shouted, “Enough, Tian Wuzi! Those two aren’t members of the Righteous Dao . Leave them be! We have more important matters to attend to!”

Tian Wuzi could only hatefully glance at Man Huzi after hearing this and begrudgingly turn around .

Not long after, the Righteous Dao walked past the stone gate and entered the Inner Hall .

Zenith Yin glanced at the Righteous Dao cultivators as they left and applauded Man Huzi with a sinister smile, “Brother Man had done good in attacking them! We don’t want any annoying rats scurrying around us before the big event . Those two Core Formation cultivators actually wished to enter the Inner Hall and take advantage of the chaos for their own gain . How the living are so impatient . Still, there is still one person here who Brother Man still hadn’t killed . ” Having said that, his gaze fell upon the Bone Sage .

The Bone Sage was completely calm and indifferent as if Zenith Yin was talking about someone else entirely .

Man Huzi expressionlessly said, “This person has somewhat of a connection with me . As he had done me a favor, it is natural that I do not attack him . You two are also forbidden from disposing of him . ”

Zenith Yin narrowed his eyes and carefully examined the Bone Sage, confirming whether or not he recognized this person . He then ambiguously said, “Since he is a junior with relation to Brother Man, it is only natural that we won’t dispose of him . Although, it is quite surprising that Brother Man would accept a favor from someone . ”

Man Huzi’s face grew cold and he intensely glared at Zenith Yin, “Hehe! Zenith Yin, you dare to interrogate me?”

“How could I possibly? I was merely a bit curious! If Brother Man doesn’t wish to answer, then so be it . But, it seemed the black robed woman who escaped should have significant origins . Brother Man has best be careful!” Zenith Yin conceded the matter with a chuckle, but his last words seemed to carry some heavy meaning .

Man Huzi was silent for a moment before gloomily saying, “I am not blind . Did you think I didn’t see her use Old Devil Three Yang’s Azure Flamebursts? Apart from his most intimate disciples, no other disciples of the Azure Flame Sect could possibly acquire such an item . How else could that young woman possibly escape death?”

“Hehe, it seems I was mettling!” Seeing that Man Huzi’s expression was far from good, Zenith Yin tactfully said nothing else . ”

“It is no matter . Even if that woman is important to Old Devil Three Yang, Brother Man has nothing to fear, given his cultivator . However, it is currently a crucial period of conflict in the Scattered Star Seas between the Star Palace and both the Righteous and Devil Daos . The Old Devil’s abilities are significant, and despite originating from the Devil Dao, he is personally unaligned to the sides of good and evil . As such, we had best avoid having this man become our enemy . Let’s quickly go after the girl!” The Confucian-robed old man smoothed the matter over form the side .

Man Huzi stiffly nodded his head and said no more . It was clear that he held great fear in his heart towards Old Devil Three Yang .

These many, newly unfolded events left Han Li with heavy, complicated feelings . All sorts of distracting thoughts began to appear in his mind .

A Core Formation cultivator was killed before him as easily as one would step on an ant, yet how did Yuan Yao had managed to flee such a fate?

Since when did the Bone Sage force a relationship between him and Man Huzi, one of the top figures among the Devil Dao? It was no wonder why he was so calm .

As for Yuan Yao, she seemed to have some sort of relationship with Old Devil Three Yang, someone who could inspire fear in a hegemon such as Man Huzi .

These thoughts simultaneously weaved through his mind and he was unable to clearly arrange them for the time being .

He could only wordlessly pay attention to what Man Huzi and the others were saying in hopes he could gather some information that would allow him to form a dependable plan .

But unfortunately, Layman Qing Yi next words ended the conversation .

“Let’s quickly enter the Inner Hall! The Righteous Dao fellows won’t wait for us . We can’t let them stealthily leave us behind . ” Layman Qing Yi glanced at the huge passage past the stone gate and wrinkled his brow .

Man Huzi glanced in the direction of the stone gate and sunk into thought for a moment before silently setting off .

Zenith Yin and Qing Yi glanced at each before following after them with relaxed expressions .

Han Li, Wu Chou, and the Bone Sage naturally followed after them .

Han Li and the others slowly entered the passage until they eventually disappeared from sight .

…

Three hours later, the darkened transportation formation suddenly shined with dazzling light, followed by the emergence of two silhouettes from the formation .

They were the Star Palace elders!

At that moment, the two were cautiously looking around . After they saw that no one was around, they wore a face of relief .

One of them spoke with a slight smile, “It appears that they’ve all entered . As cunning as these old eccentrics may be, they couldn’t imagine that our Star Palace had already unraveled this transportation restriction a thousand years ago . We can arrive at this place, anytime we want . ”

The other spoke with a cold voice, “Let’s go . We must be careful by all means . We cannot allow this secret to be easily revealed unless they actually manage to extract the Heavenvoid Cauldron .

“Of course!” The first to speak nodded his head in approval .

With that said, the two shot towards the stone gate as two streaks of white light . …

Han Li was walking behind Zenith Yin and was unexpectedly beside Wu Chou, much to Han Li’s displeasure .

Possibly due to what Zenith Yin had said to Wu Chou before, Wu Chou acted very cordially to Han Li on the way . He would on occasion talk about some trivial matters with Han Li as to avoid treating Han Li coldly . It was as if his hateful gaze from before had come from an entirely different person .

But the further this fake act continued, the gloomier Han Li felt .

Han Li couldn’t help but bitterly laugh to himself in his mind, “Did Zenith Yin hint to Wu Chou that they would kill me after they acquire the treasure? Is that why Wu Chou was acting so different?”

Although he was very much worried underneath, Han Li spoke to Wu Chou with a smile, producing an fake atmosphere between the two . Even those over thirty meters away could clearly make it out .

Still, Zenith Yin and the others turned a blind eye to those as they continued forward . Every since the three Nascent Soul eccentrics entered the Inner Hall, they’ve become solemn in contrast to their relaxed, easy attitude from before .

But what baffled Han Li the most was even after such a long period of time has passed, nothing had occurred . They had neither encountered any restrictions nor dangers .

Could it be that they had triggered some sort of restriction after entering the stone gate?

With that thought, Han Li couldn’t help but further examine his surroundings .
