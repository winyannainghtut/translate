Chapter 442: Ghost King(4)

The huge black tiger’s eyes ominously glinted upon seeing the transformed flood dragons that were attempting to constrict him . With a low growl, it opened its mouth wide and shot out over ten, head-sized black light orbs in succession .

The transparent azure flood dragon was able to swipe away the first few light orbs, but it wasn’t able to block the rest . With a mournful wail, the flood dragon was shattered, revealing the flying swords .

The flying swords were knocked over forty meters away by the remaining light orbs . The swords’ azure light dimmed as if their spirituality had suffered damage .

When Han Li saw this, he felt slight regret and hastily pointed at them, causing them to streak back into his body for recuperation . Then with a wave of his other hand, he sent out another four azure flying swords, stabbing towards the huge tiger in a blur .

The black ghost shadow grew impatient upon seeing this . After taking a deep breath, it released a long, deafening shriek .

When the demon tiger heard this, it immediately lowered its head . Its neck became twisted and its two front claws dug into the ground . An astonishing scene followed!

A huge protrusion began to swell from the side of the tiger’s head . With a flash of black light, It grew to become a smaller tiger head . With the appearance of its second head, the demonic Qi surrounding its body soared . The transformation of this two headed tiger caused Han Li to tightly crease his brow .

At that moment, the two heads of the demon tiger artifact spirit widely opened their mouths and shot out a dense, overbearing barrage of black light balls towards Han Li .

Han Li didn’t dare to be careless . He formed an incantation gesture and caused his four flying swords to violently sway in mid-flight, making them appear as eight blades . With a burst of radiance, the eight flying swords then combined together to form a ten-meter-long azure sword .

When Han Li looked at the sword, his eyes flickered with a strange expression . He opened his mouth without hesitation and spat out a cloud of glowing azure light towards the huge sword .

The cloud of pure true essence caused the huge sword to radiate brilliance and release a long, clear ring, before transforming into an azure blur . As it fiercely chopped towards the black light orbs, it faintly released the sounds of thunder .

Black and azure radiance scattered upon collision, followed by a series of explosions . This display released an astonishing pressure .

The huge azure sword chopped through the light orbs with unstoppable momentum in a display of divine might . However, the black light orbs were endless . For every destroyed light orb, it seemed as if the two tiger heads would just release another wild torrent

This scene caused Han Li’s expression to sink . This was unexpected .

As he considered using other magic techniques to strike the enemy or send out more flying swords, a series of slight fluctuations occurred about thirty meters behind him, where the elusive gray ghost shadow had appeared .

Apart from its blood red eyes, its body contained no other detectable auras . It seemed Han Li hadn’t detected any abnormalities from behind him . .

The grey shadow glanced at the flying beetles surrounding Han Li . After its gaze flickered around, it silently pounced towards Han Li’s back as a thin streak of grey light, wanting to shatter Han Li’s gold core .

It didn’t care about the beetles in the slightest as it was most adept in stealth techniques . At that moment, his body had already become formless, with nothing to fear from the beetles . Under these circumstances, it was confident its claws would end Han Li before he could even react .

The ghost shadow’s cultivation art was extremely strange . It shot towards Han Li as a grey blur at amazing speed without producing the slightest sound .

As the grey blur quickly approached Han Li’s back, the gold-silver beetles began to hum and swarm towards it .

The grey shadow was startled . Before it could react, the swarm of gold-silver beetles had blocked his path forward and were swarming towards him . In an instant, the grey blur became covered in the swarm of gold-silver beetles, creating a silhouette of twinkling gold and silver glints .

With furious alarm, the grey shadow trembled several times in an attempt to throw off the beetles . This proved completely ineffective, and soon his body began to feel an intense, strange sensation .

After a moment of daze, it turned its head downward, resulting in a gaze of terror from its blood-red eyes .

The beetles that it had disregarded were now eating away at its incorporeal ghost body . Although their bites took much effort, they were truly eating away at his formless ghost body a mouthful at a time .

The grey shadow became panicked and started to undergo continuous transformations . In one moment, it had turned into a pitch-black fog; in another, it turned into a scaled phantom . But regardless of the transformation, the cloud of beetles firmly stuck onto his body, and he was incapable of breaking away from them .

In a short moment, his body was being devoured by at least several thousand exotic insects .

At that moment, Han Li finally turned his head to coldly glance at the grey shadow .

Without wasting the breath to say any nonsense, he released two more spirit beast pouches into the sky, summoning two additional swarms of droning, gold-silver insects into the air . The two huge swarms joined the existing swarm in devouring the grey shadow .

The grey ghost shadow eventually released a deafening, fearful scream towards the black ghost shadow for aid .

When the black shadow heard this, it revealed a trace of apprehension .

It glanced at the huge azure sword that was deadlocked with the huge tiger artifact spirit and appeared hesitant . But soon it narrowed its green glowing eyes before transforming into a ghost cloud and merging with the body of the demon tiger . The black tiger immediately released a pained, violent roar . Its body then stood erect and underwent a transformation, shrinking its forelegs and thickening its hind legs .

One of the faces of the tiger heads became indistinct for a moment before turning into a shaggy man’s face that was covered by dense black Qi . As for the other tiger head, its eyes became even more brutal .

“Spirit Possession Technique!” Han Li felt his breath go cold as he involuntarily whispered the name of this magic technique .

This technique was similar to the “Greater Possession Technique” that allowed one to enter a living body, but it had an entirely different use .

Not only did the “Greater Possession Technique” not increase one’s strength, it only allowed one to make use of the original body’s strength . It was only a convenient magic technique to control a body from a long distance away . There also weren’t many consequences from using it .

As for the Spirit Possession Technique, it couldn’t be used on other cultivators . It could only be used on demon beasts that didn’t hold much intelligence .

After possession, not only would the cultivation of the caster and the target’s cultivation fuse, but their lives would be fused after a single use . If either party were to perish, it would bring the other party down with them . But what was most inconceivable was after fully making use of the Spirit Possession Technique, an entirely new individual will be created with a consciousness that possessed the memories and experiences of both parties, but neither of their wills .

Although the duration of the spirit possession was short initially, the more frequent the technique was used, the longer it would last . Eventually, the consciousness of the newly created individual would become dominant, and the technique would become incapable of reversing .

Ironically, the lifespan of this half human, half demon monster was pathetically short despite its great cultivation . Its astonishing power came at the cost of consuming an astonishing portion of its own life essence . It wouldn’t last long before it eventually expired .

Additionally, rumor had it that cultivators that used the Spirit Possession Technique would have their souls forever wandering the abyss, incapable of reentering the cycle of reincarnation . This topic had caused many cultivators to pale while chatting about it .

But fortunately, very few cultivators knew about the Spirit Possession Technique, and even fewer actually practiced it . After all, it could end with oneself turning into a half human, half demon abomination .

The appearance of the ghost shadow and demon tiger’s fusion was exactly as was rumored of the Spirit Possession Technique . However, this secret technique should only be capable of being used by cultivators . He hadn’t heard that demon ghosts were capable of using it . But what was most astonishing was that he had done it with his own artifact spirit .

Doubt was unconsciously written all over Han Li’s gloomy face while vigilance surged in his heart .
