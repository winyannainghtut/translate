Chapter 430: Wen Siyue

Han Li was startled by her yell and he couldn’t help but look over and examine the woman .

“You’re a disciple of the Exquisite Sound Sect?” Han Li asked with a calm expression .

The young woman appeared to be about twenty years of age and had a face of soft jade with skin as fair as snow . Her flowery expression of pleasant surprise revealed a very sweet charm .

“Disciple Wen Siyue pays her respect to Elder Han!” This lovely young woman hastily flew to Han Li’s side and respectfully gave him a bow . Her body wasn’t lacking in neither grace, given her firm chest and ample bottom . In addition to the young woman’s sweet voice, he could detect an intoxicatingly sweet fragrance from her .

Han Li calmly sized her up and slowly asked, “How did you recognize me? Have I seen you before?” Han Li felt slightly puzzled as he was certain that this was the first time he had seen her .

“Although this is the first time Junior has paid her respects to Senior, the sect master hung several of Senior’s portraits in the offerings hall . I’ve seen them every time I passed by . ” The young woman respectfully said .

Han Li was stunned and didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry . He didn’t think that those three woman from the Exquisite Sound Sect would actually do something like this . This must be one of their method of disseminating the fact that he had become the Exquisite Sound Sect’s elder .

Despite feeling slightly gloomy, his face didn’t reveal the slightest peculiarity, and he turned his gaze towards the middle-aged man to the side, and spoke with a slight smile, “Brother Wen, I haven’t seen you in so many years . It seems you’re doing well!”

Ever since the middle-aged man saw Han LI, his face had appeared odd . Now, his expression had become even more complicated . When he looked at Han Li, his gaze seemed to contain both admiration and a feeling of self-inferiority .

“I didn’t expect that Senior Han would still recognize me . Although I’ve seen your portrait at the Exquisite Sound Sect, I didn’t dare to believe it given that so much time had passed . Congratulations on Senior’s Core Formation . ” He spoke with slight bitterness .

This middle-aged man was actually the youth Wen Qiang that Han LI originally met at Stalwart Star Island .

Although his appearance resembled that of his youth, his hair was now growing white, and his face showed signs of aging . It seemed he was on the verge of appearing elderly .

“There is no need for Brother Wen to call me Senior . After all, we were acquainted when we were still of the same generation!” Han Li spoke with a smile .

Han Li saw that Wen Qiang was only at mid Foundation Establishment and wouldn’t have any hope of Core Formation . Han Li couldn’t help but inwardly sigh upon seeing a youth at his prime had become so elderly .

In truth, even if Wen Siyue didn’t yell for him to stop, he would’ve done so anyways . With his outstanding memory, he would’ve recognized Wen Qiang from a single glance despite not having met him many times . As he had originally given Han Li a good impression, it was only natural for Han Li to lend him aid in passing and not stand by and watch him die .

After hearing Han Li, Wen Qiang stated that he didn’t dare to do so . Han Li could only follow suit .

When the young woman heard the two chatting, her mouth slightly widened from alarm .

Her soft, spirited eyes blinked several times, wanting to ask something . But she was interrupted when Han Li spoke with a cold voice towards the three enemies, “Where do you three think you’re going? Did I say you could leave?”

The three enemy cultivators were panic stricken upon seeing a hostile Core Formation cultivator arrive . But after seeing that Han Li didn’t seem to mind them and was happily chatting, they couldn’t help but slowly fall back and test their luck .

The three turned deathly white upon hearing Han Li . After exchanging a mutual glance, they immediately flew off on their magic tools with defensive magic tools and barriers of all colors at their side .

“Humph! You’re courting death!” Han Li coldly snorted and lightly flicked his finger, shooting out three brilliant streaks of azure light, appearing behind them in a single instant .

Pff . Pff . The three cultivator’s magic tools and defensive barriers were shredded through like paper by the thick swordlights . With three simultaneous miserable screams, their magic tools filled the sky with fluorescent lights before disappearing without a trace .

After the young woman and Wen Qiang watched Han Li’s extermination of the three Poison Dragon Union cultivators, they couldn’t help but look at Han Li with even greater respect .

Han Li inwardly nodded his head . While these three azure essence swordstreaks appeared unremarkable, they actually consumed a significant amount of spiritual power . Regardless, Han Li was quite satisfied as they were able to kill Foundation Establishment cultivators in a single strike . It seemed that the azure essence swordstreaks had increased in power along with his cultivation .

Han Li seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Ah, that’s right . Since you both have the surname Wen, does that mean…”

When Wen Qiang heard Han Li, his face revealed embarrassment, and he replied, “Senior Han jests . Siyue is my daughter . ”

Han Li was stunned, but soon burst into laughter, “Then I must congratulate Brother Wen! Fellow Daoist Siyue has reached Foundation Establishment at such a young age . Perhaps she will one day reach Core Formation as well!”

Having heard that, Wen Qiang laughed with a prideful expression, “I won’t conceal this from Senior Han . Siyue is truly my pride . She became Foundation Establishment after only a little more than twenty years . I have high hopes for her . While I won’t be progressing any farther, I can only hope for her to travel farther than I ever did . ”

Wen Qiang then looked at the young woman with a tender expression, causing Siyue to turn her head away in embarrassment .

Han Li looked at the young woman with a smile and faintly nodded his head . Wen Siyue was gifted with remarkable aptitude .

Afterwards, Wen Qiang and Han Li each spoke about their own experiences .

Although they didn’t have a particularly deep friendship, meeting an old friend after many years of separation was always a pleasant matter .

From their excited chat, Han Li heard a story that was not uncommon to cultivators with mediocre aptitudes throughout the Scattered Star Seas .

Not long after Han Li departed, Wen Qiang’s master had met the end of his lifespan during cultivation . After muddling around Stalwart Star Island for several tens of years, he managed to barely breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage . After that, he started to wander through all sorts of islands and accumulated experience . Then after sometime, he met a female disciple from the Exquisite Sound Sect and became one of their external affairs disciples .

From then on, he handled all sorts of miscellaneous tasks for the Exquisite Sound Sect . But shortly after his daughter Siyue was born, his wife died from a strange illness . Due to his deep love for his wife, he decided not to remarry and raised Wen Siyue by himself . Naturally, she had been brought in to be a disciple of the Exquisite Sound Sect .

Having heard this, Han Li inwardly sighed several times and bitterly laughed . In contrast, his own experiences were quite simple . Apart from cultivation, there was practically nothing for him to talk about .

But in the end, Han Li asked the father-daughter pair why they were fighting at this remote place . In response, Wen Qiang appeared furious while his daughter appeared sad .

Han Li was greatly baffled by this .

After some hesitation, Wen Qiang slowly gave an explanation .

When Wen Siyue grew to adulthood, she was to marry a young cultivator with limitless prospects and become his Dao companion . Unfortunately, the young cultivator perished in a fight against other cultivators shortly after they were wed .

As such, the newly available and charming Wen Siyue attracted the eyes of many male cultivators in the sect . But as Wen Siyue was just recently widowed, she didn’t wish to quickly remarry . As such, she turned down her many requests for pair cultivation . Consequently, she unconsciously offended a high ranker in the Exquisite Sound Sect and was assigned to a dangerous and strenuous task: she had to retrieve a precious material from within the Poison Dragon Union’s territory .

With his daughter in such a dangerous situation, Wen Qiang naturally couldn’t stand idly by and instead accompanied his daughter on the journey . However, their secret tasks had been discovered by the Poison Dragon Union at an unknown time through unknown means . As a result, the father-daughter pair had been chased down by three three Poison Dragon Union cultivators and were forced to fight with their lives on the line .

If chance had not brought Han Li by them, they were certain to have met a horrible end .

Upon hearing Wen Qiang’s indignant words, Han Li stroked his chin and remained silent for a long while . Wen Qiang’s words implied that he wanted Han Li to seek justice on their behalf .

However, this was only one side of the story, and he wasn’t willing to recklessly involve himself in the internal affairs of the Exquisite Sound Sect over such a shallow friendship .
