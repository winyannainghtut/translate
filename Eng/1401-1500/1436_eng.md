Chapter 1436: The Sparring Arena

Han Li walked along a stone path in a leisurely manner and admired the view around him .

At first glance, there was no one there, but when he raised his head, he found a few people that were flying . The Flying Spirit Tribe were originally accustomed to flight, so the paths on the ground were mostly for decoration .

When Han Li thought of how many powerful Flying Spirit Tribe members have gathered, he couldn't help but inwardly sigh .

Let alone other things, the seventy-two branches of the Flying Spirit Tribe each had a group of elders as well as a group of thirty-some elders overseeing the entire tribe . Their power far exceeded that of Deep Heaven City . After all, during times of peace, Deep Heaven City only had ten Body Integration elders standing guard . During war, the demon and humans could gather together nearly a hundred Body Integration existences, but this was the power of two races . Alone, neither the humans nor demons could hope to rival the true power of the Flying Spirit Tribe .

As for the number of Deity Transformation and Spatial Tempering existences, that wasn’t something that the humans or demons could rival .

In that case, despite how long the humans had established themselves in the spirit realm, they were considered a somewhat weaker power .

Comparatively, the Flying Spirit Tribe’s power wasn’t as high as the legendary races of the spirit realm, but they were enough to be considered a mid-grade existence .

As Han Li inwardly pondered this, he turned a corner and discovered a small booth in front of him . It connected to several other roads .

There were two wooden chairs in the booth, occupied by two white-clothed women that were having a pleasant chat .

When they saw that someone else had arrived, they stopped and looked over .

One of the two was a dainty woman that had led Han Li’s group to their residences, Xiao Zhu .

After some thought, Han Li politely asked, “So it was Lady Xiao Zhu . Could you tell me if my companion has passed this place recently?”

Xiao Zhu stood up and answered with a smile, “Young Master Han must be talking about his Junior Sister Lei . Not long before, I have seen her pass by . She seemed to be heading in the direction of the sparring arena . ”

Han Li’s heart dropped and he asked, “The sparring arena? Was she alone?”

Xiao Zhu blinked and gave a meaningful smile, “No, she was accompanied by the Chi Rong’s Young Miss Hong Sha . ”

“Many thanks!” Han Li’s face remained calm and he gave a brief smile before heading towards the path to the sparring arena .

When the two white-robed women saw this, they exchanged a glance of astonishment .

The Tian Peng holy disciple remained calm upon hearing that his companion was led there by a hostile branch . He was quite unordinary .

Unbeknownst to them, Han Li only appeared calm while he was actually quite angry .

That Tian Peng woman Lei Lan didn’t know what was good for her .

Although he didn’t know what the Chi Rong did to get her over there, it was clear they didn’t have any good intentions . If they deliberately injured her under the guise of an accident, the chances of passing the trial would grow even slimmer .

He couldn't remain indifferent about the matter .

After all, he placed his name in the Tian Peng Vow and made a supplemental agreement with Jin Yue . If he didn’t have one of the holy disciples become a holy master, he would be greatly troubled .

He was certain the Tian Peng Elders wouldn’t leave him alone as their clan was annexed .

When Han Li recalled the particulars about the earth abyss trial, he inwardly sighed .

This time, he would acquire important benefits from the Tian Peng race, but he was also drawn into trouble .

Even if he assisted the Tian Peng in escaping their dilemma, he would also need to make proper plans to leave .

With that in mind, Han Li stepped forward calmly and eventually arrived at the corner . Then, he flickered and blurred out of sight .

The so-called sparring arena was found easily . It wasn’t as far as Han Li had imagined .

After making use of his quick movement abilities, it only took him the time to finish a meal before he arrived at a huge light barrier . He faintly heard the sounds of an explosion from there .

His expression stirred and he ceased his movement techniques, instead moving closer on foot .

Since Chi Tian had taken the initiative to tell him Lei Lan’s whereabouts, their plan should’ve been to challenge him .

So long as he doesn’t appear, the Chi Rong won’t immediately make trouble . Furthermore, even if they were impatient to act, it was too late for him to do anything so there was no point in rushing .

With that in mind, Han Li’s eyes flickered with blue light as he gazed into the light barrier .

It appeared people were making full use of their abilities in battle .

Fortunately, those that were battling didn’t use any transformation abilities . One of them was controlling fire and the other breathing blue icy Qi . Han Li was relieved that neither of them was Lei Lan .

The woman controlling the fire should be the Chi Rong’s holy disciple Hong Sha .

Feeling somewhat baffled, Han Li suddenly sensed someone looking at him with icy eyes from a distance .

As Han Li possessed sharp senses, he immediately looked back to find this person .

However, Han Li only felt his heart tremble . The glance immediately disappeared and he couldn't find the person in the crowd .

Han Li’s expression sank and he pondered for a moment . He gave up on his search and quickly made his way to the sparring arena .

But before he arrived, the raging flames and icy Qi fiercely flashed, instantly deciding the outcome of the battle .

The blue-winged man instantly was repeatedly pushed back by the raging flames and he eventually conceded and dropped to the ground .

Hong Sha, a beauty to begin with, wore a seductive smile and said, “Junior Sister Lei, I’ve already dealt with him . If you want the Lightning Star Stone, I’ll hand it over to you if you defeat me . I definitely won’t break my promise .

Many of the Flying Spirit Tribe’s men felt their minds roil when they saw her face .

Han Li inwardly shouted ‘no’, but at this distance, there was nothing he could do .

A ball of white light flashed and floated to the sky . They had a slender figure and silver wings .

She was Lei Lan without a doubt .

Han Li’s face sank .

The Chi Rong woman had instantly defeated an opponent in an instant and was now challenging Lei Lan .

It clearly wasn’t a coincidence . It was clear someone had spotted him and secretly informed her, thus setting their plan into motion .

However, he took several breaths and his expression became calm once more . He rushed forward to the side of the stage and looked for a nearby area before standing still .

Lei Lan expressionlessly said, “You used the Lightning Star Stone to drag me here from my residence . You’ve wanted to fight me in any case . Regardless of your intentions, so long I can acquire the stone, I won’t hold back . ”

She spread her silver wings and bolts of silver lightning appeared in the air . They quickly spread across her body as if she were a spirit of lightning .

Hong Sha paid no mind to this and giggled, shooting a glance in Han Li’s direction . “So it turns out that Junior Sister has some skill . I’ll definitely present the Lightning Star Stone to you . ”

A few of the branches below knew of the resentment between the Chi Rong and Tian Peng and began to whisper to another . They planned to enjoy the drama that would ensue .

Han Li stood in place with his hands behind his back without any intent to interrupt them .

Hong Sha giggled, but she inwardly felt somewhat anxious .

If Han Li didn’t stop them, then she wouldn’t be able to use the tricks she prepared . It appeared she would have to change her plans .

The woman pondered for just a moment and didn’t hesitate any further . She formed an incantation gesture and red light brightly glowed from her body . Bowl-sized red fireballs began to appear around her, filling the sky with red lights .

The temperature in the arena massively rose and became difficult to endure .

Those with lesser cultivation among the spectators were forced to take several steps back before they could endure the heat .

Han Li’s brow stirred when he saw this, but he remained in his original place .

When Lei Lan saw this, she wordlessly spread her wings and cast a spell .

Thunder rang from the air and the lightning wrapped around her grew several times thicker . From a distance, it looked as if a huge silver python was coiled in the air before it scattered into countless silver threads in an attack .

Each of the silver threads flashed, drilling holes through the fireballs .

In the blink of an eye, thunder clapped to no end . Countless fireballs erupted and turned into scattered embers .

The ability to control strands of lightning not only surprised Han Li, but it also turned the spectators restless .

Hong Sha also revealed a trace of surprise, but soon, she sneered . With a shake of her sleeve, she released a red mist and had it dance around her .

As the red mist brushed through the air, the embers gathered to the red mist and concentrated towards Hong Sha .

In the blink of an eye, a huge fire cloud appeared in the air, completely hiding Hong Sha from view .

The fire cloud roiled without end and a series of waves rushed outward . But soon, it condensed back to the center into a giant thirty-meter-wide fireball . The fireball turned in the air and let out a fearsome hum before flying in Lei Lan’s direction .

Lei Lan’s face slightly changed and she raised her hand . Silver light erupted, followed by a clap of thunder .

Her entire arm was wrapped in countless thin arcs of lightning . In a silver flash, they fused together .

With a loud eruption, a huge arc of lightning shot out from her arm to directly meet the giant fireball .
