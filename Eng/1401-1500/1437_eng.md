Chapter 1437: Test

With a clap of thunder, a thick bolt of silver lightning entered the huge fireball .

Just as most of the crowd believed the silver lightning penetrated the fireball, the lightning disappeared in a flash as if it were consumed .

In her alarm, the fireball quickly arrived before her with astonishing momentum .

After some brief hesitation, Lei Lan shot backwards and folded her wings around her .

Suddenly, layers of lightning began to form around her . In the shining light, she transformed into a silver-white Peng bird . Silver lightning jumped across her body and an odd necklace appeared around her neck . A dazzling golden gourd several inches tall floated on top of it .

She finally decided to use her last trump card and strike down her opponent .

When the huge fireball saw the Peng bird, it immediately stopped its tracks . As a muffled explosion boomed, the fireball suddenly transformed into a scarlet firebird .

The firebird was several times larger than the Peng bird, but the Peng showed no fear . With a clear sound, its entire body massively surged in size, rivalling that of the firebird . Afterwards, countless bolts of lightning shot out from its mouth .

The firebird was fearless as well and surged its flames . It clawed at the air, releasing ten crimson claw streaks .

The huge wingspan of the birds along with the increasing chaos of the battle concealed nearly half of what was occurring inside the light barrier .

Blood and feathers occasionally fell from the air .

But an instant later, whatever fell to the ground would instantly disappear .

This was expected by the crowd . After an early-grade spirit general like Lei Lan transforms, they wouldn’t continue to stall the battle while at a disadvantage but aggressively attempt to turn the tide .

The lightning surrounding her entire body turned from silver-white to a faint purple and its might greatly increased .

Han Li stared at the lightning bird with his Brightsight Spirit Eyes and an odd expression appeared on his face .

The others only believed that the lightning bird used a technique on itself to increase the might of its lightning .

But with his spirit eyes, he could clearly see that the purple lightning wasn’t something that was produced from the bird’s body . It came from the small golden gourd that floated around its neck . When a spark of purple lightning from the goard touched the bird’s silver lightning, they seamlessly fused together, turning her silver lightning to a faint purple .

The purple lightning sparks also seemed to have quite a background .

Hong Sha was caught off guard, furious at having lost control of the battle .

Although she didn’t know what Lei Lan did, she clearly used an extraordinary technique . Otherwise, Lei Lan wouldn’t prove to be her opponent, given her cultivation .

At that moment, Hong Sha heard several male voices in her ear . Although their voices weren’t loud, they caused her heart to tremble . She promptly discarded her last trace of hesitation and spread her wings in preparation of using her killing move .

A strangely long feather shot out from the top of firebird’s head .

Then in a burst of flames, the feather turned into an exact copy of the firebird . It opened its mouth and immediately spat out a chain of fireballs, creating a wave of roiling flames inside the arena barrier .

The Peng bird was immediately overwhelmed by the attack from the second firebird . Seeing that she wouldn’t be a match, Lei Lan let out a furious shriek .

Fire and lightning collided . The light barrier shuddered and the nearby air began to faintly warp .

This also blurred the battle between the firebird and the silver Peng .

However, it was clear that the silver bird was facing eminent crisis and wouldn’t hold out for much longer . Perhaps she would soon be defeated with heavy injury .

Han Li observed this in silence for a moment longer before he suddenly spread out his wings . In a clap of thunder, he turned into a bolt of white-azure lightning .

Meanwhile, a black silhouette flickered from another point in the crowd and also silently vanished .

Bang! A thirty-meter-long golden sword light appeared in the air, cleaving through the clashing fire and lightning as soon as it appeared .

But before the swordlight reached the battle, a faint white arc suddenly appeared in front of it, producing a sharp metallic shriek .

Fire, lightning, and the white arc collided, destroying all trace of one another .

When the two firebirds and the silver Peng saw the flash of golden light, an incredibly sharp attack had arrived above their heads and swung down .

The three birds had no way to block it .

In their alarm, they couldn't continue the battle . They immediately withdrew their attacks and retreated .

The huge sword light harmlessly fell between the two sides . As for the white arc, it remained in its original place but soon released enormous energy .

A windstorm was conjured near it . A large quantity of worldly essence Qi gathered at the white arc as if a spatial tear was about to open .

The spectators of the battle were thrown into chaos . The lightning bird in particular withdrew her lightning and turned back into her young woman form with an expression of bewilderment on her face .

“You aren’t a match for her . Don’t continue to struggle . ” A faint voice sounded from behind Lei Lan as if the speaker was right behind her .

The silver-clothed woman’s face changed and she hastily turned around to find a youth standing there, Han Li .

“So it was Han Li who had taken action!” Lei Lan said with bewilderment .

The power of the swordlight was something she had expected from a Great Spirit General .

The fearsome swordlight and the white scar it produced had disappeared . The worldly essence Qi turned calm as well .

But at that moment, Han Li wasn’t looking at Lei Lan but was staring across from her .

Startled, Lei Lan followed his eyes .

She discovered that Hong Sha also returned to her human form and withdrew her doppelganger . She looked over at them with a mysterious smile .

After Han Li separated them, a red-clothed youth with a harsh expression had appeared at her side .

The youth was Zhu Yinzi, the Chi Rong holy disciple Lei Lan was most wary of .

Lei Lan couldn't help but feel a chill over her heart .

Zhu Yinzi smirked and said, “Brother Han, I heard that you’ve been cultivating overseas all this time and have only recently returned to the Tian Peng Race . I am quite curious about your abilities . Could you teach me a thing or two?”

The strike Han Li had just released caused his heart to sink . From that display, he knew Han Li’s abilities were quite powerful . But in order to take measure of Han Li’s true power, he calmly challenged Han Li in accordance with their original plan .

Zhu Yinzi’s reputation far outshined the likes of Hong Sha and Lei Lan .

With his appearance, the spectators immediately recognized him . With news that Zhu Yinzi had challenged someone else, the crowd grew excited .

It was rare to see two equals of great power face one another . The difference in fame was clear, but the other was a high-grade spirit general . The fight was likely to display things that were rarely seen .

Lei Lan frowned when she heard this, but a flash of realization suddenly appeared on her face . It appeared she finally saw that the Chi Rong’s objective was her Senior Martial Brother Han standing behind her . She was only bait .

“I have no interest in fighting you . ” Han Li smiled and spoke with a casual tone .

“Hehe, since you’ve already entered the restriction, you cannot refuse . Brother Han, please take my attack . ” The youth raised his hand . With a red flash from his palm, it turned into a scarlet claw, revealing five sharp points that glistened like red gems .

Han Li frowned . Without another word, the youth swiped his scarlet claw through the air .

Space ripped as the five scarlet talons shot forward . They instantly vanished after a flash of red light .

Han Li’s expression stirred, suddenly raising his arm, spreading out his pitch-black fingers in front of him .

Suddenly, the air thirty meters in front of him violently shook where five claw streaks appeared and blurred towards him .

Han Li’s expression faintly changed when he saw the scarlet streaks appear . They were originally only a foot-long, but when they reappeared, they were three-meters-long . The attacks were continually absorbing nearby spiritual Qi and surging in size .

But before the streaks grew close, Han Li already sensed an astonishing spiritual pressure directly approaching him . If his cultivation was weaker, the claw streaks would’ve froze his body and mind, preventing him from reacting as the streaks overwhelmed him .

As Han Li felt completely aghast, his pitch-black fingers suddenly flashed with light, producing a small black mountain in the air . In a flash, it immediately turned thirty-meters-large .

Han Li was now securely protected with the black mountain in front of him .

Red light flashed, followed by successive muffled bangs .

A burning heat drifted towards Han Li, causing him to feel slight burns, but the mountain remained floating in the air, completely unharmed .

“Yi!” Zhu Yinzi was shocked by this result .

Han Li’s spiritual sense quickly brushed past the Essensefused Mountain and his face sunk .

Bang . He slapped his palm on top of the small mountain .

The mountain promptly spun in the air, now pointing the side that was struck in Han Li’s direction .

On the mountain’s black surface, there were partially melted five inch-deep claw marks .

Han Li coldly snorted and pressed his black hand on the mountain .

Black light roamed across the mountain for a spell, mending all the damage that it had incurred .

“Since Brother Zhu wants a lesson, I’ll have to provide instruction . ” With that said, he blurred, appearing at the side of the mountain .

He flapped his wings, revealing an azure Peng phantom from his back .

Meanwhile, a chain of booms sounded as four azure tornados soared to the sky around him, filling the air with their screams .
