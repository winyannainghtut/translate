Chapter 1440: Untitled

On the morning of the second day, Bai Bi and Lei Lan descended to the first flood and quietly joined their elders who were calmly standing there as if they were waiting for something .

Both of the elders appeared somewhat hopeful, causing the two holy disciples to feel somewhat baffled . They also looked turned to look at the stairwell .

In the time it took to finish a meal, footsteps sounded from above . In a blur, Han Li appeared at the bottom of the stairs with a smile on his face .

Elder Shi’s eyes lit up and he asked, “Did you succeed?”

Han Li smiled, “Many thanks for your kindness . Senior . I almost have it entirely grasped . I should be able to use it to face the enemy . ”

Jin Yue closely examined Han Li’s face and said, “Very good . This trial will prove much more dangerous than normal . Although Fellow Daoist Han possesses the cultivation of a high-grade Spirit General, I fear you will counter powerful enemies you won’t be able to face . That is why Elder Shi and I have prepared to hand over a clan protecting treasure to you . As such, if you truly come across something unexpected, you’ll be able to defend yourself . ”

“A clan protecting treasure,” Han Li said with a tone of surprise .

“That’s right . This is the Lightning Wyrm Scissors . Take it . ” As she spoke, she shook her sleeve and sent out an azure light .

Han Li unconsciously raised his hand and took the treasure into his hand .

Under closer examination, he found that the scissors were only a half-foot long and appeared quite old . Its surface was a deep azure, but the mysterious silver talisman designs showed it was no ordinary item .

Han Li stroked his hand across it and sensed a deep icy Qi . With joy in his heart, he asked, “Seniors, are you truly lending this to me?”

“In truth, there were several other treasures in the tribe that are more suitable for use in the earth abyss, but I fear those treasures will take up too much time to refine .

These Lightning Wyrm Scissors aren’t nearly as troublesome . So long as you infuse it with spiritual power, you will be able to use its awesome power to strike down your enemies . As a result, the treasures are also easily seized by enemies as well . Fellow Daoist Han should use it with care . ” Jin Yue solemnly warmed .

“Many thanks, Senior . I will take great care using it . ” Han Li didn’t hold back and took the treasure with a smile, knowing that this grand treasure was being handed over in order to help preserve the safety of the holy disciples .

Jin Yue nodded and spoke to both Bai Bi and Lei Lan but took out nothing else .

Han Li didn’t pay this any mind .

The two should’ve already been given treasures before they parted from the holy city . During Lei Lan’s battle with Hong Sha in the sparring arena, the golden gourd she used should’ve been one of those treasures .

A short moment later, the five walked out from the building and soared to the sky .

There were various other branches that had gathered there earlier .

This time, none of them were mounted on birds or flying insects . They were all floating with their wings .

Also, the holy disciples of the Flying Spirit Tribe’s various branches were gathering together, separated from their elders .

The holy disciples were now much different than the day before . They wore solemn expression and were whispering to one another .

Han Li blinked, simply bringing his fellow holy disciples to the corner of the group and remaining silent .

But not long after, Han Li sensed people looking at him . As his heart stirred, he looked back in their direction .

Three hundred meters away, there was a short skinny girl examining him .

Her skin was dark, but strange black tattoos were drawn on her neck .

When she saw Han Li looking at her, she smiled, revealing a mouthful of pure-white teeth .

Han Li felt his heart tremble!

He quickly swept his spiritual sense over to her and found that she was also a high-grade Spirit General . The strange aura on her body faintly gave him a sense of danger as if she cultivated a peculiar technique .

Han Li showed none of this on his face, instead merely moving his lips .

Standing at the side, Bai Bi with his eyes shut suddenly heard Han Li’s voice transmission .

He opened his eyes in a start and glanced at the skinny short girl . His face greatly changed and he hastily lowered his head .

With a voice of awe, Bai Bi replied in a voice transmission, “Brother Han, that is the Sevenpass Race’s Ao Qing . She is even more famous than Zhu Yinzi and is one of the most capable disciples of our generation . However, she is incredibly ruthless and her temperament is odd . She’ll take the lives of others without provocation . Brother Han had best avoid her attention . ”

Han Li frowned . Just as he thought why that woman was examining him, he suddenly sensed a gloomy look aimed at him . This time, he felt genuine hostility .

Han Li’s expression sank and he looked to the side .

At another corner of the crowd, he saw Zhu Yinzi and the other Chi Rong disciples look at them with hostile expressions .

Han Li coldly returned a glance and expressionlessly looked away .

Given the Chi Rong’s attitude to the Tian Peng, they were certain to be up to no good . Han Li felt ill at ease over the matter .

Because Han Li and company had come somewhat later, they didn’t have to wait for much longer .

An hour later, the three grand elders from the council and the azure-armored man appeared in front of the crowd . The entire group then began to move forward and arrived at a small mountain in front of a huge wall .

For some unknown reason, the wall was completely barren . There weren’t any patrols or watches above the wall .

The azure-armored man then walked in front of the elders and spoke a few words, pointing at the wall .

A huge rumbling sounded and the wall stirred . In a flicker of rainbow light flashed, a faint silver spell formation appeared .

When the azure-armored man saw this, he immediately opened his mouth and spat a purple wooden badge .

The badge brightly lit up and released a purple beam of light . It flickered several times before striking the heart of the formation .

Suddenly, the silver spell formation roiled and beaming light roamed . The formation suddenly vanished, but a huge silver gate appeared underneath the wall .

The door was a hundred meters tall, gleaming with an icy light . From appearance and weight, it appeared to be formed from pure silver .

The azure-armored man wordlessly put away the wooden badge and swept his sleeve to the huge door in the distance .

Suddenly, a purple light mist swept out and struck the huge gate .

A huge gong sounded as the silver gate slowly opened .

A grey demonic wind immediately blew out from the gate . As it passed, the holy disciples shuddered, feeling as if knives were being pressed against their skin .

It was a truly odd sensation .

When Han Li felt how odd the wind was, blue light shined from his eyes .

The huge gate opened . Without any hesitation, the holy disciples began to walk through the gate .

When Han Li saw what was behind it, he felt his blood run cold .

As far as the eye could see, there was only black land, completely lacking light and even a single blade of grass . Be it stone or sand, it was only black as well .

The sky was covered in a grey mist that appeared quite dense . It was impossible to see through from below and seemed to have no end .

There were cracks in between the mist and the earth about a hundred meters tall, but one could hear winds harshly whistled without end as if the cracks would consume everything .

Everyone that heard this couldn't help but feel a chill .

‘So this is the earth abyss gate . It looks dangerous as expected,’ Han Li muttered to himself .

The old woman with a cane then said, “Alright, we’ve arrived . Apart from holy disciples, no one else will take a step forward . The earth abyss gate is a myriad kilometers outside the mist . ”

Although her voice wasn’t loud, everyone could clearly hear it . Those that were restless immediately calmed down .

The white-haired man chuckled, “Since we’re here, you all must be anxious . Let's begin making the details clear . ”

The old woman glanced at the white-haired man and calmly said, “The council of elders would like to inform you that the demons marked for this trial will be different from the past few . If you bring back an Infernal Flame Fruit, you will have passed . This spirit fruit is different from the others in that it is found in the areas that are darkest and filled with filthy Qi . The fruit needs to be about five hundred years of maturation and each tree only bears one fruit . The darkness on the first level won’t be enough for the fruit to grow . Of course, if you’re lucky, you could find it there . On the second floor, they may grow there in a small number, but we don’t guarantee anything . The third floor is where it is guaranteed that the fruit will grow and in great numbers as well . Act in accordance with your judgment . You have three months . After those months, the gate will open again to receive you, regardless if you’ve succeeded . I hoped you listened well . ” The old woman’s voice was powerful . Knowing the odds of survival through the trial, Han Li listened to each and every one of her words carefully .

The tattooed old man sullenly commanded, “Since we’ve told you the details of the trial, you may set off . In three months, I hope I will see most of you again . As for the others, you will turn back . The Devil Sealing Gate will close again . ”

With a wave of his sleeve, he made his way back to the outside without any intention of looking around .

The white-haired man and the old woman exchanged a glance before closely following after him . The others in the council of elders silently followed them . As for the branch elders, they took a few looks at their clan’s holy disciples before heading back .

Only a small portion of them sent them off with a voice transmission .

In the blink of an eye, the huge gate disappeared, leaving behind a few hundred holy disciples looking at each other in dismay .
