Chapter 1435: Zhu Yinzi

“I must trouble you,” One of the Chi Rong holy disciples said with a respectful tone . Although the woman’s cultivation wasn’t high, he didn’t dare to slight her .

As there were many in the Chi Rong Race, they sent seven holy disciples . The Pentaluster Race sent five .

The one that sent the least were the Tian Peng Race, three including Han Li, and this was with leaving nothing behind . The other branches of the tribe were sure to keep a few holy disciples hidden and not send them .

Furthermore, the holy disciples of the other two branches were at mid-Deity Transformation stage at the very least . Bai Bi and Lei Lan were in truth a grade lower .

From this, it could be seen how weak the Tian Peng Race was when compared to the other branches . It was no wonder the higher echelon of the Tian Peng race had used such effort to rope him in . It would be a common occurrence for stronger branches to target them .

The strong preying on the weak was the rule of law in the spirit realm as well .

With that in mind, Han Li followed after the Chi Rong disciples along with the Bai Bi, Lei Lan, and the Pentaluster disciples .

They all obediently followed after her for a long distance .

Of the many Chi Rong holy disciples, the one that caught Han Li’s attention the most was a man with a sinister face and hostile eyes .

The other Chi Rong holy disciples had about the same cultivation, but only this cultivator gave him a feeling of danger .

With that thought, Han Li couldn't help but look at his back with narrowed eyes .

A beautiful Pentaluster woman that appeared in her twenties sweetly smiled at Han Li and asked, “What? Could Brother Han be interested in Zhu Yinzi?”

Although Han Li was only a fake holy disciple, his cultivation was still at high-grade spirit general . Be it the Chi Rong or the Pentaluster Race, they all viewed Han Li as the leader of the Tian Peng holy disciples .

And with his unfamiliar face, he should’ve been a concealed reserve . The other two tribes viewed Han Li with greater attention .

During their travels, the holy disciples hadn’t spoken to each other as Jin Yue and the other elders were present . Now that they were separated from the elders, the woman decided to open a conversation .

Of course, this was also because the Tian Peng always maintained friendly relations with the Pentaluster Race .

As for the Chi Rong holy disciples, they decided to ignore Han Li for the time being .

Han Li indifferently answered, “It’s nothing . Brother Zhu’s baleful Qi is quite deep . I suspect he has much battle experience . ”

“It seems Brother Han’s story of cultivating overseas is true . Zhu Yinzi has been resoundingly famous amongst the younger generation . He has entered the earth abyss seven times already . Although he didn’t head deep inside, he killed many demons . He is as famous as the Sevenpass Race’s Ao Qing and the Nan Long Race’s Fei Ye . It is said that their abilities are no lesser than a mid-grade Great Spirit General . ” The Pentaluster woman replied with a smile . It seemed she didn’t care if the Chi Rong disciples heard her .

“So it was like that,” Han Li answered calmly with a nod . He then said nothing else .

When she saw Han Li’s indifferent attitude, the Pentaluster woman became somewhat more interested . But before she could say anything, the white-clothed maid arrived in front of several seven-story tall buildings .

The maid turned to face the holy disciples and said,

“You may choose which building each of your races may occupy . But there is something I must remind you of . On Jade Emperor Peak you may only spar with those from the eastmost branches . You may not fight with anybody from the other areas . Otherwise, there will be grave punishments like the destruction of one’s cultivation .

The party of cultivators felt their hearts tremble . A handsome Chi Rong man then stepped forward and said, “We understand . Thank you for your trouble . ”

The white-robed young woman smiled and saluted to the holy disciples, “I am called Xiao Zhu . I will be attending to all of your minor necessities . If there is anything you require, please find me . ”

Afterwards, nothing else was said and the groups entered the building of their choice .

Han Li chose the tallest of the buildings . As for Bai Bi and Lei Lan, they chose two of the lower floors .

After several months travelling at breakneck speed, even Han Li felt tired .

Without another word, he sat cross-legged on his bed and shut his eyes .

An unknown time later, he opened his eyes to see a dark sky .

He nimble walked off his bed and stretched, then walking to a lower floor .

He found that Bai Bi was meditating in his room and that Lei Lan had disappeared, somewhat to Han Li’s surprise .

He recalled that before they set off . Jin Yue had given them a thousand warnings that they mustn’t leave the group and give enemies an opportunity .

With some thought, Han Li felt somewhat ill at ease and walked out with his hands behind his back .

As they were involved with the success of the earth abyss trial, ignoring her was out of the question .

“Yi! Isn’t that Brother Han? What a coincidence!” A leisurely voice sounded as someone walked out of another building .

Han Li blinked and looked over in the direction of the voice .

He saw a youth with a round face, a Chi Rong holy disciple . He wore a smile on his face .

Han Li was expressionless, but he coldly chuckled in his mind .

‘If they truly met by coincidence, it was a matter to curse over . He was most likely standing guard and calmly waiting for us to come out . ’

Although he didn’t know what he planned, it can’t be anything good .

Han Li looked at the young man without a word .

The Chi Rong man paid no attention to Han Li’s cold demeanor and chuckled, “Why is Brother Han so distant? Our clans may have a few contrary views, but there is no need to be so hostile before the earth abyss trial . In the future, if your clan is truly to enter our Chi Rong Race, we’ll become brothers . ”

“If our clans truly become one, that is possible . ” Han Li narrowed his eyes and showed a slight smile .

The round youth was stunned by Han Li’s quick change and soon smiled as well .

“I am Chi Tian and this is also my first time on Jade Emperor Peak . How about we walk around together?” Chi Tian spoke as if they were good friends .

“With you?” Han Li raised his brow .

“This place restricts battle . Do you fear that I’ll plot against you?” Chi Tian smiled .

“Not at all, but I have no interest in being friends with you . ” Han Li’s expression sank .

When Chi Tian felt that he was being played, a hostile expression momentarily appeared before his smile returned .

After a moment of silence, the young man slowly said, “Brother Han must’ve come out to find your clan’s Lady Lei . ”

“What do you mean by that?” Han Li said with an icy tone .

“It’s nothing . I simply saw Lady Lei Lan travel with my clan’s Senior Martial Sister Hong Sha . It seems they planned on comparing pointers at the arena . I told you so you didn’t have to waste your time looking,” Chi Tian said with a fake smile .

“Then I must thank you for your warning . ” Han Li creased his brow for a moment and saluted the man before flying off .

When he saw Han Li was a distance away, Chi Tian sneered .

“Junior Martial Brother Chi, you’ve done well . ” After Han Li vanished down a road, a voice sounded from behind Chi Tian .

A figure blurred from the building door . He was a tall skinny man with skin that was a far deeper red than ordinary Chi Rong people . A trace of hostility appeared in his eyes .

With a faint change of expression, he respectfully said, “Senior Martial Brother Zhu, it was only a small matter . Anybody could’ve done it . That person may be a high-grade spirit general, but why has Senior Martial Brother taken note of him? We should be able to deal with this person with ease . ”

“Junior Martial Brother Chi, your words are mistaken . If that person is who I think he is, all of you wouldn't be a match for him . ”

“Senior Martial Brother knows that person?” Chi Tian was stunned .

Zhu Yinzi suddenly asked, “Does Junior Martial Brother know how Tian Ming and his subordinates were repelled several months before?”

After some hesitation, Chi Tian truthfully answered, “I have heard about it . It was said that no only did they fail their mission, but they lost a high-grade Chi Hou bird and a Fire Dragon Pearl .

Zhu Yinzi licked his lips and wore an odd expression, “At that time, this person alone had repelled Tian Ming and killed the Chi Hou bird . He should be this High Holy Disciple Han . ”

Chi Tian’s expression vastly changed and he spoke with a tone of disbelief, “That’s impossible . Senior Martial Brother Tian Ming was a mid-grade spirit general and the others also had spirit general grade cultivation . The Chi Hou Bird also should’ve been as powerful as a mid-grade spirit general . ”

Zhi Yinzi gloomily said, “Tian Ming had personally given me an account . Since the Tian Peng had recalled this holy disciple from overseas, it should be this person . I suspect that he possesses high-grade spirit general cultivation, or else he would’ve have been able to repel Tian Ming and the others . ”

The round youth blinked and hesitantly said, “Then the Tian Peng Race does have a trick up their sleeves . Originally when their holy master perished, it was said they didn’t have a single holy disciple and that they’d be annexed into the Chi Rong without a doubt . Now, three more holy disciples have appeared and one of them is a high-grade spirit general . This is truly surprising . ”

Zhu Yinzi sullenly said, “Its nothing . After all, the Tian Peng Race has existed since ancient times . It comes as no surprise if they have some secrets they’ve still kept hidden . However, the elders have made it clear that we should unite other tribes in dealing with the Tian Peng as we cannot allow them to have another holy master . This one named Han Li most likely is the most hopeful of the Tian Peng Race . Before he enters the earth abyss, we must verify his true abilities . I don’t want to perform something that has no chance of succeeding . ”

Chi Tian said with a beaming smile, “Senior Martial Brother’s words are reasonable . Let’s go to the sparring arena . He must’ve gone there . ”

Zhi Yinzi chuckled, “Of course . With the few numbers of Tian Peng holy disciples, he must want to keep an eye on them . If something bad happened to one of them, he’ll be taking responsibility .

The two immediately soared to the sky and directly flew east .
