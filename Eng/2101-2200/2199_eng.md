At Han Li's current level of power, there was virtually no issue in the human race that could stump him, so he wasn't overly concerned about the situation.

"I'd be happy to explain everything to you, Brother Han. Fellow Daoist Du, Fellow Daoist Han has just returned to the city, so you wouldn't mind if I filled him in on the recent state of affairs, would you? After all, this matter concerns his disciple," Elder Gu asked with a serious expression.

"My disciple?"

"Of course not."

Han Li faltered slightly upon hearing this, while Du Yu immediately agreed to the request.

"Indeed, this issue concerns one of your disciples, Brother Han. Am I correct in stating that you have a disciple who possesses a recessive lightning spiritual root, Brother Han?" Elder Gu asked.

"You must be referring to Hai Yuetian. He does indeed possess a recessive lightning spiritual root, but I don't recall ever telling anyone about this; how do all of you know about this?" Han Li asked as his expression changed slightly.

"Apparently, your disciple unintentionally revealed this on his own during a drunk ramble at a gathering," Buddhist Monk Jin Yue explained.

"I see. This disciple of mine has always been quite scatterbrained, so I'm not surprised to hear that. Go on, Brother Gu," Han Li sighed in a resigned manner.

Elder Gu offered a rather awkward smile before continuing, "I'm sure you're even more aware of the special properties of a recessive lightning spiritual root than we are, Fellow Daoist Han. The elders of the holy island were informed of this matter, so they issued an invitation to your disciple not long ago to borrow the power of his recessive lightning spiritual root. I'll get Fellow Daoist Du Yu to disclose the rest of the situation to you," Elder Gu said, deferring to Du Yu to continue the explanation.

All of the other elders present were thoroughly impressed by Elder Gu's wily deflection.

If he were to tell Han Li everything in the stead of the holy island envoys, it wouldn't be right of them to express any displeasure here, but they definitely wouldn't be pleased, nonetheless.

Thus, Elder Gu was essentially doing Du Yu a favor by allowing him to elaborate on the situation, and now that the negotiation was going to take place between Han Li and Du Yu, the panel of elders wouldn't incur the wrath of the holy island nor Han Li regardless of the final outcome.

Du Yu immediately saw through Elder Gu's intentions, and he nodded as he said, "In that case, allow me to explain the situation. The recessive lightning spiritual root possessed by Brother Han's disciple is extremely important to both our human and demon races. Aside from Senior Mo Jianli and Senior Ao Xiao, there are no other Grand Ascension Stage being among our two races, and both of them are at quite an advanced age, so we won't be able to rely on them for much longer."

Du Yu paused momentarily here, and solemn looks appeared on everyone's face upon hearing this.

"Without a Grand Ascension Stage being to act as a guiding force, the fate of our two races will immediately fall into dire straits. As such, the holy island has been doing its best to create another Grand Ascension Stage being for our two races. If another Grand Ascension cultivator could arise among our ranks, we still won't be able to compare with the superpower races of the Spirit Realm, but the safety of our two races will be guaranteed for tens of thousands of years. As such, the elders of the holy island have agreed to pool together all of the island's resources to assist the late-Body Integration Stage beings on the island in their breakthrough attempts.

"As such, we are inviting your disciple to the island for the greater good. I hope you can see the bigger picture and allow your disciple to come with us to the holy island, Brother Han."

It was clear that Du Yu had already recognized Han Li to be the biggest obstacle that stood before him, so he was speaking directly to Han Li and completely disregarding the elders of Deep Heaven City.

"So what you're saying is that the holy island sent three envoys to the city for a disciple of mine," Han Li summarized as a cold look appeared on his face, and the displeasure in his voice was very apparent.

Du Yu's heart jolted slightly upon hearing this, but he displayed no intention of backing down. "I can assure you that no mortal peril will befall your disciple on the holy island, and our holy island will be sure to reward him handsomely for his efforts."

"This disciple of mine has only been with me for a short time, and his cultivation base isn't all that advanced. If he were to use his recessive lightning spiritual root to nullify a Grand Ascension Stage true lightning tribulation, he would at least have to progress to the Spatial Tempering Stage to be of any use at all. I know of around seven methods that can forcibly enhance one's cultivation base to that extent, and all of them require the overexertion of one's latent potential and lifespan. Even if my disciple doesn't perish during the tribulation, he won't be able to benefit from the rewards given to him by the holy island anyway." Han Li's expression darkened even further as he spoke, and a hint of mockery had crept into his voice.

"Your disciple will indeed be incurring a certain level of risk here, but the prosperity of our two races hinges on this matter; I'm sure I don't need to educate you on which is more important between a single person and two entire races, Fellow Daoist Han," the yellow-haired man seated beside Du Yu interjected.

"I am, of course, well aware of that, but I want to know if my disciple's inclusion will guarantee that a new Grand Ascension Stage being will arise from the holy island. If you can swear that on your inner demons, then I'd be happy to let him go with you. Otherwise, if the chances of success are very slim, then why should my disciple sacrifice himself for nothing? Do you think I'm someone that you can walk all over without repercussions?" Han Li had done away with all semblance of pleasantries at this point.

The three holy island envoys' expressions all became quite strained upon hearing this, while the elders of the city exchanged a few glances before choosing to continue to remain silent.

It was clear that the panel of elders had decided that they were going to take no further part in this issue.

"Brother Han, I think that if your disciple can increase the chances of a new Grand Ascension Stage being arising among our two races even by just a sliver, then it's not a sacrifice for nothing. You're not planning to completely disregard the orders of the holy island and the entirety of our two races, are you? If so, then you might have to answer to the elders of our holy island," the hideous woman accompanying Du Yu threatened.

"Oh? Is that supposed to be a threat? You three are constantly going on about the holy island and our two races; do you really think the three of you can represent our two races? I haven't been cultivating for all that long, but if you think you can fool me with such broad and abstract terms, then you're dead wrong. If I hand over my disciple to you like this, I'll be viewed by everyone as a master who can't even protect his own disciples," Han Li countered in a frosty voice.

The hideous woman immediately flared up with rage upon hearing this, but Han Li raised a hand to cut off what she was about to say, and continued, "I can tell you now that unless your holy island is 100% confident that sacrificing my disciple will produce a Grand Ascension Stage being for our two races, then I won't let him go with you."

"Is the Grand Ascension Stage bottleneck a joke to you, Fellow Daoist Han? If it were that easy to produce Grand Ascension Stage beings, then there would be far more of them in our two races than there currently are; you're being extremely unreasonable here, Brother Han." Du Yu had also run out of patience at this point.

"You want me to sacrifice my disciple for nothing, yet you're calling me unreasonable? I can see that you're quite a powerful cultivator, Fellow Daoist Du; you must be one of the candidates selected by the holy island for a Grand Ascension Stage breakthrough, right?" Han Li asked with a cold smile.

"I am indeed one of the chosen candidates; do you think I'm not up to standard, Fellow Daoist Han?" Du Yu asked as a cold look flashed through his eyes.

"That's not for me to decide. However, seeing as you're doing everything for the greater good, would I be correct to assume that you'd be willing to offer all of your treasures and pills to help me when I attempt my Grand Ascension Stage breakthrough? If you can truthfully say that you'd be willing to do that, then I have nothing to say," Han Li replied in an expressionless manner.

This question clearly caught Du Yu off guard, and he faltered momentarily before replying in an awkward manner, "I'm... afraid that I can't do that, Fellow Daoist Han. The pills and treasures provided to me for my breakthrough attempt were all prepared by the holy island, so I don't have the right to give them to anyone else."

"That's quite a pity. Seeing as you're not willing to make sacrifices for the so-called greater good, then don't even think about sacrificing my disciple. If that's all you want to discuss with me, then you can return to the holy island now," Han Li said with a mocking expression as he gave a dismissive wave of his hand.

The expressions on the faces of the three envoys darkened even further upon hearing this.

"Brother Gu, Master Jin Yue, both of you are on friendly terms with Fellow Daoist Han; would you be able to persuade him? If I don't return to the holy island with Fellow Daoist Han's disciple, neither your city nor I would be able to answer to the elders," Du Yu said in a meaningful voice.

Elder Gu cursed Du Yu internally for involving him in this matter again, and after a long hesitation, he finally said with a wry smile, "It's... not really my place to be interfering with this matter. How about both sides comprise slightly?"
