The flying carriage continued on toward the center of the devilish cloud without pause like a shooting star.

Due to the large section of the cloud that had been dispersed, a giant passageway with a diameter of around 500 meters had been revealed.

Right at this moment, two cold voices rang out from either side of the flying carriage.

"Prepare for trouble!"

"And make it double!"

As soon as the voices trailed off, a bolt of black lightning that was over 100 feet in length erupted out of one side of the black cloud amid a loud thunderclap, hurtling directly toward the flying carriage as a lightning wyrm.

Meanwhile, a giant green sword projection emerged from the cloud on the other side before also sweeping toward the carriage.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this.

Even though both of the assailants were still concealed within the mist, it was clear from their attacks that they were no ordinary devilish lords.

Of course, these attacks weren't enough to pose a threat to him. He immediately swept a sleeve through the air while pointing at the green sword projection with his other hand.

A thick bolt of golden lightning erupted out of his sleeve amid a rumbling thunderclap, while a streak of sword Qi shot forth out of his fingertip.

He was fighting lighting with lightning, and sword with sword.

The four clashed, and bursts of piercing light erupted forth, then quickly faded in unison.

It seemed that the attacks were all evenly matched.

Han Li faltered slightly upon seeing this, and the two devilish beings concealed within the cloud were also very astonished.

The attacks unleashed by the pair of devilish beings seemed to be quite ordinary, but they were actually imbued with incredible power.

The black lightning was one of the Elder Devil Realm's four types of divine lightning, and it possessed extremely potent corrosive power, able to instantly erode the average treasure.

As for the azure sword projection, that was a bonded ability that the other devilish being had cultivated for close to 10,000 years, and it was capable of slicing through the average flying sword with ease.

However, Han Li had instantly nullified both of their attacks, seemingly with ease, and that naturally came as quite a shock to the pair of devilish beings.

Han Li had no intention of lingering here, and he stabilized the flying carriage, which was shuddering slightly from the shockwaves resulting from the explosions, before it continued to fly toward the massive passageway.

The two high-grade devilish beings were infuriated to see this, and they instantly cast their bewilderment aside before attacking again.

On this occasion, countless arcs of black lightning sprang forth from one side of the cloud, while a sword projection that was five times larger than the previous one emerged from the other side.

The two attacks had been unleashed virtually in unison, and instead of being directed toward Han Li, they had been aimed at the entrance to the passageway, thereby instantly sealing it.

If the flying carriage wanted to enter the passageway, then it would have to pierce through the attacks.

As opposed to being alarmed by this, a cold smile appeared on Han Li's face, and he instantly transformed into a giant golden ape that was several tens of feet tall amid a flash of golden light. His arms then thickened drastically as he threw a pair of devastating punches upward with all his might.

In his Giant Mountain Ape form, Han Li's strength had already reached an incredible level, and even a Grand Ascension Stage being wouldn't dare to take the full brunt of his strength head-on.

The space up ahead rippled and warped violently, and a pair of giant golden fist projections that were as large as small mountains crashed down with enormous force.

An earth-shattering boom rang out, and the arcs of lightning and sword projection were instantly shattered by the fist projections.

Thus, the flying carriage was able to instantly fly into the spatial passageway without any further impediment.

After that, the five-colored flashed within the passageway alongside a burst of spatial fluctuations, and the flying carriage was nowhere to be seen.

Only then did a pair of humanoid figures hurriedly fly out of the black cloud.

The two of them quickly flew over to the entrance of the spatial passageway and peered into its depths with panicked expressions.

One of the devils was a handsome purple-robed young man with a horn on his head, while the other was a white-armored, dark-skinned devilish being with fiery red hair.

"What do we do? We let them get away! They're not going to run into each other, are they?" the dark-skinned devilish being asked in a frantic voice.

"Surely there wouldn't be that much of a coincidence; they only said that they'd be returning from the Spirit Realm today, but didn't give an exact time," the other devilish being said with a calm expression that was clearly slightly forced.

"I certainly hope they don't run into one another. In any case, we're definitely going to get punished for this. Who the hell was that? Aren't they afraid of drawing the ire of the Sacred Ancestor by forcing their way into the spatial passageway?" the dark-skinned devilish being said with a resentful expression.

"That man possessed unfathomable powers and was able to easily nullify our attacks, so he's definitely not a normal devilish lord, but he doesn't seem to be a Sacred Ancestor, either," the purple-robed devilish being remarked.

"He's definitely not a Sacred Ancestor. He is indeed very powerful, but he's still far from reaching that level. Besides, if he really were a Sacred Ancestor, he would've simply revealed his identity to be granted passage," the dark-skinned devilish being replied as he shook his head vigorously.

"But if he's not a devilish lord, then how is it possible that we haven't heard of such a powerful devilish lord? Perhaps we should ask the others to see if they were able to identify him," the purple-robed devilish said with furrowed brows.

"Even we were unable to determine his identity; those useless fools most likely weren't even able to see what he looked like, so there's no way they'll be of any help to us," the dark-skinned devilish being said in a disdainful manner as he looked down at the several streaks of light that were approaching them.

"In any case, it can't hurt to ask; perhaps we'll be able to gather some leads," the dark-skinned devilish being countered.

Shortly thereafter, the streaks of light arrived on the scene, revealing a group of devilish lords, all of whom immediately extended respectful salutes toward the pair of devils.

The dark-skinned devilish being wasted no time as he instantly swept a hand through the air, conjuring up projections that bore the appearances of Han Li's trio.

"Do any of you know who these people are?" he asked in a cold voice.

The group of devilish lords looked carefully at the projections being presented, then exchanged a few helpless glances before a thin and gaunt man finally stepped forward with a careful expression. "According to our knowledge, it's very likely that those were powerful beings from the Spirit Realm's human race!"

"The human race?" The dark-skinned devilish being faltered slightly upon hearing this, as did the purple-robed devilish man.

"Indeed. The two of you have constantly been in seclusion ever since you were assigned to this place, so it's no surprise that you're unaware of the recent events that have unfolded. Almost our entire holy realm has been made aware of this human cultivator, and there are even rumors of Sacred Ancestors being defeated by him," a devilish woman hurriedly explained.

Expressions of incredulity immediately appeared on the faces of the two devils upon hearing this. "Is that so? Give us more details on this."

"Several years ago..." Thus, the thin and gaunt devilish lord immediately began to recount Han Li's recent exploits, and the two devils listened with rapt focus.

......

Within the spatial passageway, the flying carriage had been enveloped within a series of light barriers, and was quickly racing through the darkness.

Han Li stood at the front of the flying carriage, having already returned to his human form, and his expression had eased significantly.

In several hours, they'd arrive back in the Spirit Realm.

Even though they were going to arrive in the Wood Tribe territory, he was still very excited at the prospect of returning home.

Time slowly passed by, and the flying carriage continued onward without encountering any impediment.

Just as Han Li was estimating that most of the journey had been completed, spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted up ahead, and a massive war ark that was over 1,000 feet in length emerged before hurtling directly toward them.

Han Li was naturally very alarmed by this, and a cautious look immediately appeared on his face.

Generally speaking, one would refrain from initiating a battle in a spatial passageway in fear of triggering violent spatial storms, but if the people on the ark were to completely disregard that and attack him nonetheless, then he would naturally have to retaliate.

Judging from the aura and size of the giant ark, its owner was most likely not just some ordinary devilish lord, so he had to be very careful.

The flying carriage and giant ark were both traveling extremely quickly, and within the span of a single breath, they had reached one another.
