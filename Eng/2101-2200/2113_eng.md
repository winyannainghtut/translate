Han Li knew that the golden crab would definitely be extremely powerful, but he didn't think that its attack would be so fast and fearsome.

The golden scissors had reached him without giving off any spatial fluctuations, so it would be impossible for him to evade.

With the fearsome power that the golden scissors had displayed, no defensive treasure would stand a chance against it.

In this dire situation, Han Li immediately let loose a loud cry as he raised the arm in which the Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword was sealed, and dark green runes surged over his skin as his arm transformed into the sword before being slashed through the air, unleashing a huge green sword projection.

At the same time, Han Li flipped his other hand over, and his skin instantly turned a purplish-golden color.

He spread his fingers open, and a burst of five-colored glacial flames surged forth, forming a five-colored ice shield before him. Simultaneously, grey light erupted from his body as the Divine Essencefused Light also formed a light barrier around him.

After that, he quickly opened his mouth to expel a ball of silver flames that shot forth toward the oncoming attack.

A resounding boom rang out, followed by a loud crack.

The golden light on one side was able to break through the azure sword projection, but it was repelled by the arm that was covered in green spiritual symbols while the arm itself remained completely unscathed.

However, the golden light on the other side was able to slice through the five-colored ice shield and grey light barrier with ease. It was slowed down slightly by the silver fireball, but then reached Han Li in a flash and tore through the protective spiritual light around him as if it didn't even exist.

The two halves of Han Li's body plummeted down from the heavens, and the golden light swept forth to shred them into scraps of blood and flesh that rained down from above.

The golden-robed man immediately burst into raucous laughter.

"Haha, I had thought that you'd be able to put up a decent fight, but you're nothing special. To think that Bao Hua and Yuan Yan were forced to comply to you; they sure have become useless during my absence. "

Right at this moment, the golden crab said something that immediately cut off the golden-robed man's laughter.

"The first attack was unable to kill the target; now unleashing the second attack."

As soon as the voice trailed off, the giant golden crab raised two of its huge pincers upward in unison. Layers of golden runes then surged out of his body in a frenzy before forming a giant ball of runes that had a diameter of over 1,000 feet.

The mass of the ball was astonishing, and it was glowing with scintillating golden light.

All of a sudden, spatial fluctuations erupted over 1,000 feet away, and an azure-robed humanoid figure appeared.

It was none other than Han Li, and his face paled as he cast his gaze toward the golden ball of runes.

The golden-robed man faltered slightly upon seeing this before immediately realizing what had happened. "So you possess a treasure that was able to die in your stead. You're a lucky rascal, but this next attack will end your life anyway!"

Han Li completely disregarded the golden-robed man's gloating and continued to appraise the golden ball of runes with a dark expression.

Even though he had managed to withstand half of the first attack with his Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword, the other half of the attack was able to tear through his defenses with ease.

If he hadn't used his blood essence to activate that tribulation transcendence substitution puppet refined from the Weeping Spirit Blood Wood, he would've at least been severely wounded, if not killed on the spot by that attack. [1]

This golden ball of runes that the golden crab had conjured up was clearly more powerful than its first attack, so Han Li had no choice but to unleash his most powerful life-saving techniques.

He let loose a low roar as he made a hand seal, and his body expanded drastically in size. In the blink of an eye, he had transformed into a golden ape that was over 1,000 feet tall, and at the same time, his Provenance True Devil Projection appeared behind him amid a flash of golden light.

He then laid a hand onto the top of his own head, and a golden Nascent Soul that was around half a foot tall appeared.

The Nascent Soul wore a grim expression as it chanted an incantation, following which several true spirit projections emerged amid a burst of scintillating light.

All of the projections, including the Provenance True Devil Projection, rose up into the air before converging toward the Nascent Soul.

Brilliant golden light erupted amid a resounding boom, and the giant ape instantly began to shrink, transforming into a tall and broad humanoid figure that was around the same height as the average grown man.

The humanoid figure's entire body was of a shimmering golden color, and the entirety of its skin was covered in a layer of golden scales. There was a single azure horn on its head, and an inky-black demonic eye on its glabella.

It was still Han Li, but in this form, he gave off a very unsettling appearance, and there was bright bluish-golden light flashing incessantly within his eyes.

In the next instant, another golden head appeared on his shoulder amid a flash of golden light, and this was accompanied by a pair of shimmering golden arms that sprouted from beneath his ribs.

He had undergone the Second Nirvana Transformation to adopt an extremely fearsome-looking devil form.

"Holy Nirvana Physique!" the golden-robed man exclaimed with incredulity upon seeing this.

By the time he had arrived at the Bitter Spirit Island, Han Li had already entered the Spirit Cleansing Pond, so he had no idea that Han Li had also cultivated the Holy Nirvana Physique. On top of that, he was even capable of undergoing the Second Nirvana Transformation, and that was naturally quite astonishing to the Nie Pan clone.

However, the giant golden crab paid no heed to either of them and unleashed its attack.

It abruptly brought two of its giant pincers together to clamp down onto the giant ball of runes, then hurled it toward Han Li with devastating might.

Han Li's two heads chuckled coldly in unison as he raised his dark green arm, and in the next instant, countless dark green runes surged out of his arm before forming a dark green sword projection.

The sword projection was only around three feet in length, and Han Li grabbed onto it before slashing it toward the golden ball of runes without any hesitation.

Due to the cultivation base and time constraints, Han Li was still unable to unleash the Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword's true power, but this sword projection was still far more powerful than the average Divine Spirit Treasure.

The entire sky within a radius of several tens of kilometers immediately dimmed, and countless five-colored balls of light that were formed by the world's origin Qi appeared in the surrounding area before surging toward the sword projection in a frenzy.

The streak of sword Qi unleashed by the sword projection was initially only just over 100 feet in length, but with this influx of the world's origin Qi, it swelled to over 1,000 feet in length as arcs of golden lightning appeared over its surface.

In the instant the giant ball of runes came into contact with the massive streak of sword Qi, over 1,000 huge rune projections appeared over its surface, each of which was shimmering with golden light and rapidly rotating while flashing incessantly.

An earth-shattering boom rang out, and green and golden light exploded between Han Li and the golden crab, sending powerful shockwaves sweeping outward in all directions.

One half of the sky was colored green by the sword Qi, while the other half was glowing with golden radiance.

The clash between the two only lasted the span of several breaths before the golden rune projections on the golden half of the sky converged to form around a dozen mountainous golden rune projections, which crashed toward the green half of the sky with devastating force.

With each clash that took place, one of the giant rune projections would vanish, but these projections were imbued with the power of laws, and after eight clashes, the green half of the sky completely crumbled.

Han Li's expression changed drastically upon seeing this, and he withdrew the dark green sword projection in his hand before lashing out with all four of his arms at once.

Four pavilion-sized golden palm projections instantly appeared before thrusting them forward in unison, and the shattered fragments of the vast expanse of green light fused back together again to just barely keep the golden light at bay.

However, the green light was only able to hold itself together for a brief moment before the rest of the giant rune projections arrived, and the four golden palm projections were also instantly destroyed.

Thankfully, this split-second delay was enough for Han Li to transform into a four-winged giant bird that vanished on the spot as a thread of golden and silver light in the blink of an eye.

In the next instant, a vast expanse of golden light swept through the spot where Han Li had been standing before, then quickly continued onward into the distance.

In the blink of an eye, a vast expanse of space had been filled with scintillating golden light, but this only lasted for a short time before the giant golden crab opened its mouth to drawn back all of the golden light, upon which the sky returned to normal.

Meanwhile, the golden-robed man was hovering in the air above the golden crab while quickly scanning his gaze through the surrounding area.
