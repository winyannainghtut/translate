Chapter 531: Indifference to a Pleading Request

The middle-aged man let out a long breath, and muttered, “Senior doesn’t know about the Beast Torrent? It seems that Senior has secluded himself for many years and isn’t informed on the affairs of the outside world . ”

“From your tone, the circumstances sound quite grim!” Although the man’s voice was quite cold, his words carried a trace of interest .

The middle-aged cultivator was speechless . The circumstances on the outside couldn’t just be described as ‘grim’! It seemed this old eccentric had secluded himself for who knows how many years . How else could he be ignorant of the disastrous event that took place twenty years ago?

However, this was of great relief to him . With this Senior’s cultivation, he should feel like it would be beneath his dignity to attack them for anything that they might have .

With that thought in mind, he middle-aged man wore a respectful expression, replying, “Senior! The Beast Torrent was an event that occurred about twenty years ago . At that time, Junior was only a Qi Condensation cultivator . Although I hadn’t personally witnessed it, I’ve heard many Seniors in my sect speak about it . It was said that countless demon beasts emerged from the depths without warning and rushed towards Wondrous Depths Island . They had completely surrounded Blackrock City and launched fierce attacks at it without end . Although the island was protected by several great formations and was defended by several thousand cultivators along with a party of Nascent Soul Seniors, the demon beasts broke through in only a matter of days . Apart from a small fraction of cultivators that were able to escape in the chaos, the rest were all slain . ”

The middle-aged cultivator spoke with a dim expression .

“Something like that happened!? And the aftermath? Did the demon beasts return to the depths?” The man’s voice momentarily revealed a trace of shock before calming down .

“Matters would’ve taken a turn for the better had they had just returned to the depths . After turning Blackrock City into ruins, they divided into several groups, each led by a few high grade demon beasts . Then they started to wipe out other human villages and establishments . However, information of the torrent had reached a majority of them beforehand and their people managed to flee and go into hiding . Still, there were many cultivators and mortals that were eliminated by these attacks . As a result, nearly half a year passed by where not a single human settlement existed . They had all been wiped out by the demon beasts, and this wasn’t the end . Although most of the demon beasts returned to the depths, there were a few intelligent high grade demon beasts that had started to search for humans in hiding, devouring them one by one . It was said that after a short time, mortals in the outer seas had been nearly wiped out, and a majority of the cultivators had fallen as well . Fortunately, there were a few islands far from Wondrous Depths Island that the cultivators were able to settle on and hide away . Currently, Wondrous Depths Island has become an outpost for high grade demon beasts . So long as they catch wind of any cultivators, they will immediately launch an attack to eliminate us . ” The middle-aged man’s expression became sorrowful .

After that, the man’s voice grew silent for a long while as if he had been heavily shaken, and needed some time to digest the information .

The voice then coldly laughed and slowly said, “Hehe! It is quite funny . We’ve swapped roles with the demon beasts . Humans are now taking the role of prey . ” His words carried a trace of mockery, leaving the cultivators stunned .

As if trying to save his breath, the voice then directly asked several questions, “Wondrous Depths Island had many Nascent Soul eccentrics on guard . They can’t have all perished in the Beast Torrent . Why haven’t they appeared and taken charge of the situation? And with such huge disaster having struck Profound Depths Island, why haven’t the Inner Star Seas responded and sent over reinforcements? Or have the forces of the Inner Star Seas completely given up on Wondrous Depths Island?”

Each following question became sharper and struck closer to the heart of the matter . As for the middle-aged man, his knowledge only covered a few of the questions .

After some consideration, he carefully answered, “During the year of the Beast Torrent, I heard that while two Nascent Soul cultivators perished in the assault, most of them managed to flee . Although there has been no news of those Seniors, word has it that they are planning something great . It is quite possibly an attack to reclaim Wondrous Depths Island . However, this Junior is unaware of the concrete details . As for the Inner Star Seas, all contact with them has been lost ever since the day of the Beast Torrent . Nobody knows what is happening on the other side . With regards to reinforcements, not a single one has been seen . It is likely as Senior said, Wondrous Depths Island has already been given up by the Inner Star Seas . ” After that was said, his face wore a gloomy expression . It seemed the cultivators fortunate enough to survive the Beast Torrent had grown apathetic towards the Inner Star Seas and unconsciously harbored resentment towards them .

The voice grew silent for a moment more before leisurely asking, “Since there is such danger, why is it that you Juniors dared to brave these dangerous seas instead of staying safely put? Are you seeking death?”

The middle-aged cultivator revealed a miserable expression, but before he could answer, the yellow-robed young woman’s expression fluctuated as she suddenly shot forward from behind the old man .

“Senior, because my father cultivated an unsuitable cultivation art, his true essence suffered backlash and his meridians are in disarray, rendering him paralyzed . With Senior’s great power, he must have a method to save him! If Senior saves my father, this Junior is willing to toil ceaselessly in order to repay your kindness!” The young woman bitterly pled with eyes overflowing with tears, invoking a feeling of tender pity .

When the others heard this, they were greatly shocked and couldn’t help but look at each other in dismay . But when the middle-aged cultivator heard this, his heart trembled and he instantly rebuked her, “Xing’er, what nonsense are you speaking? Senior Martial Brother has been bedridden for years . He is no longer treatable by ordinary means . We’ve only come on this journey to find medicine to alleviate his pain . Senior’s magic power may be profound, but that alone cannot treat your father . ” Although the middle-aged cultivator’s words were harsh, he wore an odd expression as he spoke .

The voice coldly laughed and lazily said, “His true essence suffered backlash and his meridians are in disarray? He seems to have vainly overreached himself . These are symptoms of attempting to forcefully cultivate a high level technique while his cultivation was lacking . ”

This expert was able to diagnose the cause of the illness without having personally seen the man . This caused a flicker of joy to appear on the middle-aged man’s face .

“Senior is truly knowledgeable . It was because of my Senior Martial Brother’s impatient cultivation that led to misfortune . Would Senior happen to know a technique that could save him?” After the middle-aged man respectfully praised him, he asked about the crux of the matter . It seems he has a good relationship with this Senior Martial Brother of his .

“This illness won’t take much to cure, but why would I tell you? Did you believe that I could provide my assistance without any benefit?” The voice seemed to perceive the man’s thoughts and bluntly mocked him .

The middle-aged man paused for a moment before his complexion fluctuated between red and white . Despite his moving lips, he couldn’t bring himself to say anything .

The yellow-clothed young woman gained hope from those words and a trace of color returned to her face . With gritted teeth and a beating heart, she knelt before the light barrier .

Soon after, the adorable young woman said with determination, “Junior Gongsun Xing pledges that so long as Senior can cure my father, this woman is willing to devote her life to you as your loyal servant . If Senior is not at ease, Junior is willing to enter restrictions before Senior heads out to save her father . ” With that said, the woman faced the light barrier and kowtowed her head three times against the ground . A resolute expression remained on her face .

Despite appearing so young, the yellow-robed woman was staunch .

With furious surprise, the middle-aged man rebuked, “Stupid girl, do you know what folly you are committing? Senior is a man of great status . What use does he see in a disgraceful girl like you?”

The others in the party managed to recover from their shock and each said their own words to try and dissuade her .

However, the yellow-clothed woman ignored them and continued to kneel in place . It seemed like she decided to stay kneeling until she heard his reply .

The young woman shook her pale face and calmly said, “Everyone, please stop . My talent is unclear . My mother went through much difficulty to deliver me, and my father forcefully cultivated the sixth layer of the Azure Spirit Profound Arts in order to cleanse my essence and transform my meridians, leaving himself cripple and bedridden . Now is the time that I can fulfill my filial duties . So long as my father can be cured, I am willing to devote my life to Senior without complaint . ”

“Girl, could it be that you wish to pressure me? If I don’t act, then will you stay forever kneeling?” The man’s voice coldly laughed without the slightest sympathy .

“Junior doesn’t dare . Gongsun Xing is already immensely grateful towards Senior for saving our lives! However, my father is bedridden; we’ve tried our hardest to find someone to cure him, but all attempts have failed . From Senior’s tone, Xing’er believes that this will take but a trivial effort from him . Junior’s only intention is to bitterly plead with Senior so that she may fulfill her filial duties, nothing else!” The woman’s voice was on the verge of sobbing by the time she finished . She kowtowed once more as she held back her sobs .

The light barrier remained silent .
