Chapter 554: Rush to the Exquisite Sound Sect

At Han Li’s current cultivation, even without the use of the blood-red cloak or the Thunderstorm Wings, he was capable of flight at an astonishing speed . In less than half a month, Han Li had arrived at the desolate island that was once the location of the Exquisite Sound Sect’s hidden city . After sweeping his spiritual sense throughout the island, he didn’t find a single soul . It seemed he would have to search for humans and acquire the information from them .

Han Li glanced around and casually chose a direction, before disappearing in a streak of azure light .

Since the Exquisite Sound Sect had already moved after establishing their city on this island, they shouldn’t have moved far away . Additionally, these seas should be an area where human cultivators gathered . He was confident that with his vast spiritual sense, he would be able to find some human cultivators without much effort . As expected, about half a day later, Han Li discovered traces of human cultivators on a medium sized island . Not only a single human cultivator, but many .

Looking down from the sky, he saw many male and female cultivators being besieged by two grade four demon beasts from the nearby seas .

When Han Li spotted a few familiar faces among them, he faintly smiled .

Soon after, Han Li used the appearance exchange art to assume the form of a dark-skinned middle-aged man . He then casually launched two azure swordstreaks with a wave of his hand . With a flash of light, a hole appeared through the heads of each of the demon beasts as they fell to the ground .

This display had alarmed the many cultivators below . They immediately turned their heads towards the sky to discover Han Li . An uproar had risen among the cultivators at the appearance of the newly arrived expert .

After consulting among themselves, a large man with an embroidered robe flew towards Han Li .

“Many thanks for Senior’s assistance . Is there anything that us Juniors may help you with?”

Although the large, embroidered-robed man spoke with a respectful tone, a trace of unease could be seen from his face . Just why did this Core Formation cultivator suddenly appear at this island?

Han Li didn’t immediately respond upon seeing Yi Jing, the embroidered-robed man that Han Li had teleported with to Profound Depths Island . Han Li narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze past the rest of the cultivators, only to recognize the scar-faced man Xu Yun . There were none of the other cultivators that had arrived at Wondrous Depths Island along with him .

As for Yi Jing and Xu Yun, it seemed they had failed at forming a core, since they were still at late Foundation Establishment despite the many years that had passed .

Yi Jing grew somewhat nervous upon seeing Han Li looming in silence . After a moment of hesitation, he was about to speak when Han Li had cut him off , “I am looking for the Exquisite Sound Sect’s hidden city . Do you know the next time it will be open and where it will be?”

With an indifferent expression, Han Li gazed intently at Yi Jing’s face .

When he heard Han Li’s question, Yi Jing’s expression relaxed and he tactfully replied, “Senior, the Exquisite Sound Sect’s city will be opening in about a month . The city is set to open at Twin Peaks Island . It is several days west of here . If Senior wishes to go, Junior can bring him there . ”

Han Li shook his head and mildly said, “There’s no need for that . It’ll be fine if you just give me a map . ” He had no interest in reminiscing about times long past with this person .

The man was quite lucky . He managed to survive through the Beast Torrent, but the others likely didn’t share the same fate as him, causing Han Li to feel a slight sadness .

“Yes! Senior, here is a map of the sea and the location of the hidden city . ”

Yi Jing revealed slight disappointment, but he still hoped to forge a friendly relationship with the Senior before him . With each passing day, the Outer Star Seas became increasingly dangerous . It would be greatly advantageous to be acquainted with a Core Formation cultivator .

But after taking another glance at Han Li’s detached expression, he could only drop the matter and take out a jade slip from his robes . He recorded the location of the Exquisite Sound Sect into the jade slip and offered it to Han Li with both his hands .

Han Li received it with a nod and took a quick look through it with his spiritual sense . Then without the slightest intent of staying, Han Li rushed through skies in a streak of azure light .

The low grade cultivators that were left behind gazed at him with envy . In the Outer Star Seas as of current, cultivators at Foundation Establishment and lower didn’t have the freedom to stray too far from their cave residences .

Han Li wasn’t about to meekly wait for another month . He feared that if he didn’t leave by then, Feng Xi would come knocking at his door . As a result, he was prepared to pay a significant sum to quietly teleport . Of course, if they refused or became too greedy, he wasn’t going to shy away from force .

Several days later, Han Li arrived at Twin Peaks Mountain . The island was quite expansive and had two huge mountains that were nearly the same in height .

After flying several times around one of the mountains, he found the entrance to hidden city as described on the map . After a moment of hesitation, Han Li changed his appearance back to that when he had last visited the city . He then descended at the center of the mountain and took several steps towards a tree that was ten meters wide and about a hundred meters tall .

He expressionlessly glanced at the huge tree and he couldn’t help but scoff . He lightly flicked his finger, sending three orbs of white light to directly knock against the tree’s bark .

A short moment later, azure light flashed and an opening appeared from the tree bark . A white-clothed old man at late Foundation Establishment walked out . He was the same gatekeeper that was in charge of the city the last time he was here .

The old man recognized Han Li at a glance .

After all, there were very few Core Formation cultivators that had attended the meetings of the hidden city . Additionally, he caught a few rumors in the last opening of the market city that this single cultivator had managed to suppress over ten Core Formation cultivators . It was very likely that this person was a Nascent Soul cultivator .

Upon seeing Han Li, the old man lowered his head and hastily gave him a deep salute, “So it was Senior Li . I hope Senior won’t take offense, but may I ask what is your business for coming? There is still a month before our hidden city convenes . There are no treasures for Senior to browse . ”

The old man spoke with a respectful tone, but his eyes appeared puzzled .

Han Li examined the old man and raised his head, speaking in a deliberately arrogant manner, “I haven’t come for the hidden city . I’ve come to meet Sect Master Fan or Elder Yun . ”

“You wish to see the Sect Master or Elder Yun?”

The old man paused for a moment before revealing a trace of hesitation .

“What? Can’t I?” Han Li’s tone was void of emotion and his expression grew eerie .

When the old man saw this, he shivered and immediately smiled, saying, “Of course you can!” A trace of cold sweat could be seen from his brow .

After some thought, the old man sincerely said, “Were it anyone else, it wouldn’t do . But since Senior personally arrived, Then it must be about something important . This little old man will report back . Just as it so happens, Sect Leader Fan recently arrived to take care of arrangements for the hidden city . Senior, please wait for a moment!” He decided to hand off this troublesome matter to those above him . He couldn’t afford to offend such a fearsome character!

Han Li was happy to find that Lady Fan was present and his expression relaxed . He then said, “Then please be quick about it . I don’t have much time . ”

The old man felt relief and hastily replied, “Yes, Junior will use a voice transmission talisman to inform the Sect Master . It will take just a moment!” If Han Li decided to force his way through, he would only be able to watch him helplessly . There would be no way he would throw his life away to block him . As a result, he took out a sound transmission talisman in front of Han Li and sent it into the tree’s opening .

After seeing the the sound transmission talisman disappear, Han Li expressionlessly asked, “Where is Elder Yun? Why isn’t he with your Sect Master?”

The old man’s expression grew unsightly . He hesitated for a moment before muttering, “This… Junior truly doesn’t know about the whereabouts of Sect Leader Yun . Matters regarded this recent market city were all handled by the Sect Master alone . ”

Upon seeing the old man’s expression, Han Li undoubtedly knew what the old had meant . With a cold chuckle, he no longer continued to ask the old man any questions, much to his relief .

A short moment later, the white clothed cultivator received a sound transmission talisman . After quickly examining it with his spiritual sense, he respectfully said, “Senior Li, our Sect Master invites you inside for a chat . I will lead the way . ”

Han Li indifferently replied, “Go ahead . ”

The city down below the tree was largely the same as the last hidden city . There were two floors of a large underground expanse . But this time, apart from the many low grade Exquisite Sound Sect disciples preparing the city, there were no others inside .

The old man quickly brought Han Li to a stone wall that was attended by two outstandingly beautiful female cultivators .

The two female cultivators both respectfully bowed to Han Li with a flushed complexion and charmingly said, “We pay our respects to Senior Li . The Sect Master welcomes you! She is honored by your presence . ”
