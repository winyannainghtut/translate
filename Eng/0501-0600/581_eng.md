Although Han Li and Mei Ning were new arrivals, the guards merely glanced at them without asking any questions . Instead, they surrounded the returnees and excitedly asked them a few questions . As a result, the large men gave them a glance at the fish and prawn in their bags before the guards cried out in surprise .

Han Li furrowed his brows at the sight . It seemed that food was a scarce resource here .

Soon after, Han Li swept his eyes across the entire village .

The entire village was within the protection of the tall stone walls, and all of its buildings were crudely carved cubes made from the same pitch-black stone as the walls . There was also a small stone platform built at the center of the village that was several times taller than the other buildings . Additionally, the top of the platform seem to emit a faint purple fog that permeated through the entire village . It seemed to completely absorb any of the blue lightning that happened to strike the village . The purple fog was undoubtedly some kind of spell formation, but Han Li was unable to perceive the slightest spiritual Qi inside the stone walls . Instead, he only felt a cold Yin energy lingering in the air .

Although his spiritual sense was still trapped within his body, he could still keenly sense spiritual Qi . Han Li was bewildered as to why this was the case .

The lean man’s group had entered the village and already arrived at a large hall near the platform . There were a group of people outside the hall that were gesturing and whispering with the lean man’s group when one of them looked in Han Li’s direction with a deep gaze .

Han Li felt his heart tremble . That person possessed the deepest inner strength of anyone he had encountered in this land .

Were it in the outside world, Han Li could’ve easily killed him with a twirl of his finger and ignored him . But as Han Li was now, he would have to strive his hardest to deal with him . At that moment, the lean man had approached the group of people and said something to them before turning around and pointing at Han Li and Mei Ning . The group then turned their gazes to Han Li .

Han Li remained silent and revealed no fear, but to his side, Mei Ning revealed nervousness from not knowing what they had in mind for them .

The lean man beckoned to the two and said, “You two, come over . The village elders have some questions for you . ”

Han Li nodded his head and calmly walked over with Mei Ning in tow .

The group of people that had been standing outside had already turned around and entered the hall, and Han Li soon followed .

A plump old man that sat at the center of the hall gazed at them with a kind expression and said, “Please, sit . Since we are all human, we will naturally do our best to aid one another . However, there is much that is different in this world from the outside . How about you two first introduce yourselves before I start introducing you to this land?”

The others sat down at his side, and the one who had glared at Han Li outside the hall were among them as well . He had narrow eyes, a hostile expression and pale skin . At that moment, his spirited eyes had swept across Han Li and the beautiful Mei Ning behind him . Although he was silent, a peculiar expression flickered through his eyes .

Han Li casually smiled and calmly replied, “There isn’t much to say about us . We encountered the ghost mist at sea and were drawn here by it . As for my previous identity, what use is it here? There is no point in talking about it . ”

The old man smiled upon hearing Han Li’s vague answer .

He examined the two with narrowed eyes before saying, “You two must be cultivators, so there is no point in concealing this . ” With that said, the old man’s gaze dropped down to the bulging storage pouch at Han Li’s waist .

Han Li’s expression remained unchanged but he was inwardly shocked . As for Mei Ning, her expression grew pale with worry .

“You two don’t need to be scared . Although there aren’t many cultivators among us, we are far more happy to have you join this village than we would be with ordinary people . However, you two will be incapable of using magic or spiritual power in the Umbra Realm . The only powers you’ll be able to use are a few crude martial arts and umbra energy . ”

“Umbra energy?” Han Li asked with a bewildered expression .

The old man twirled his beard and slowly said, “That’s right . It is somewhat similar to magic power, but it cannot be used to cast magic techniques . However, cultivators are able to use the inner cores of umbra beasts to deploy a few small scale spell formations . We have much use for them in our village . And even if you aren’t proficient in spell formations, cultivators’ bodies are far stronger than those of ordinary men . They will certainly be great helpers . ”

After a moment of thought, Han Li asked, “Your esteemed self seems to understand much about us cultivators . Are there other cultivators in the village?”

The plump old man smirked and said, “Of course there are, but they only number about six . This old man happens to be one of them . When I was sucked into the ghost mist, I was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator . ”

A trace of astonishment flickered through Han Li’s eyes, but when he thought to ask more questions, the entire hall violently rumbled . In the distance, there seemed to be a huge monster charging at the village .

The expressions of the people inside the hall had greatly changed, and they no longer paid any attention to Han Li . They all immediately walked out and Han Li soon followed after them with a hesitant expression . The village elders were commanding several hundred robust youths to all rush up the thick walls with pikes in most of their hands, while a few of them carried crude bows .

Although their expressions were all tense, they acted with perfect discipline as if they had already experienced this many times .

Han Li’s gaze turned in the direction of a very loud rumble coming from outside the stone wall . Although he could feel the tremors grow even more astonishing, nothing else had yet to happen .

Han Li rubbed his chin and expectantly glanced around for moment . He then walked over to a tall building nearby and took advantage of the chaos to jump off a wall and easily climbed onto the stone building’s roof . From the top of the building, Han Li was able to see what was happening .

In the distance, he saw that the stone and sand were violently scraping through the air on a bewildering black wind while a black frost spread across the ground in its wake . It appeared amazingly cold .

This seemed to be the Yin wind that the lean man had spoken of previously . It truly wasn’t something that ordinary mortals could handle .

However, as the Yin wind reached about three hundred meters from the village, it began to disappear, accompanied by heavy tremors as a large object dropped onto the ground . Although it was still a good distance away, an astonishing aura could be felt from it . Soon, a forty meter tall black figure emerged from the winds .

When Han Li saw the black figure’s true appearance, he felt his blood turn cold .

At first glance, the black figure appeared to be a gigantic grey ape, except that the beast had four eyes and a pair of wings emerging between its ribs . It carried a log of jet-black wood in one arm as it madly charged towards the village, while its four eyes were radiating with crimson light and emitted a powerful, bloodthirsty aura .

After the beast’s true form was revealed, many people started to loudly shout, “It’s an Insidious Mauler! Quickly, send over the great shields!”

In an instant, a large number of women, children, and elderly began to deliver shields of all kinds to the walls . But soon after, they began to flusteredly run away from the walls as the huge beast came within three hundred meters of the village . The tremors caused by the beast’s footsteps had left Han Li bewildered . It appeared as if the stone walls would be taken down by the tremors long before the beast even reached them .

But in the next moment, huge tentacles were formed from several strands of dense violet fog and rigidly fastened onto the huge beast’s feet . As a result, the huge beast lost its footing and fell in front of the stone wall, causing everyone in the garrison to lose their balance for a moment from the resulting tremors .

Han Li unconsciously turned his gaze to the tall platform with astonishment, and shockingly discovered that there were now four people sitting cross-legged on the platform . Their bodies were covered in a faint layer of purple Qi as if they were utilizing a technique .

‘This is umbra energy?’ Han Li’s heart stirred .

In the following instant, an order was shouted, “Attack!”

A large number of pikes and arrows were shot at the huge beast like rain, completely enveloping it .

As Han Li watched this, his heart thumped with excitement .
