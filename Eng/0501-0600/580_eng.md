The lean man turned his head toward Han Li and the woman and indifferently said, “I’m not sure whether I should say your luck is good or bad . You actually ran into an eruption of Spirit Extinguishing Qi! This causes far more tears in space to appear, and even experts are incapable of escaping them . But as a result, the umbra beasts that normally lay inside the mountain hollow had left . Otherwise, you would’ve immediately be torn apart upon falling inside . ”

When Han Li heard this, his heart sank, but his expression remained unchanged . “I hope you’ll forgive me for being so bold, but could your esteemed self tell us exactly where we are? From your tone, it seems this place is quite dangerous . ”

The lean man examined the two’s clothing and saw that they didn’t seem to be ordinary people and wryly smiled, “Dangerous? Hehe! That’s about right . Regardless of whatever identities or statuses you may have held on the outside, here in the Umbra Realm, you’re just people that need to struggle to survive . If you can’t move or make yourself useful, you will end up as umbra beast food . ”

Han Li frowned and wanted to ask more questions but the lean mean impatiently waved his hand, “We’re pressed for time . The explanations will have to wait until after we return to the village . In just a moment, the umbra beasts will return to their nests and we’ll have to quickly block this secret entrance so that we can use it again in the future . ” After he said this, he turned to the people behind him and started harshly giving them commands .

The men and women began to grab nearby stones and started to hurriedly stack them tightly against the hole .

The lean man gazed at the Yin clouds in the sky and his face darkened . “Let’s go . If everything goes smoothly, Ah Hu and the others will meet us on the way . But if we dawdle, the Yin winds will appear and we won’t be able to return . ” After saying this, he turned around and left as the rest of people closely followed after him without a word . None of them ever called out to Han Li or the woman .

When Han Li saw this, an odd expression flickered through his eyes as he began to ponder over the current situation .

The beautiful woman beside Han Li watched as the group grew distant . Seeing that Han Li appeared pensive, she couldn’t help but worriedly ask, “Should we follow them?”

Without any magic power, she had turned into a frail and bewildered mortal . Since Han Li appeared calm this entire time, she had instinctively begun to rely on him .

Han Li raised his head and calmly said, “There’s no reason not to, so let’s go take a look at their so-called village . Perhaps we’ll think of something once we’re there and are able to recover our magic power . ” He then headed in the direction the others had gone with large strides .

The woman let out a breath of relief and followed after him .

“Ah, yes . I still don’t know your name . My surname is Han, I am a vagrant cultivator . ”

“I am Mei Ning . I was together with my brother when we were sucked into the ghost mist, but now he isn’t here . ” A trace of worry appeared on her face when she mentioned her brother .

Han Li calmly said, “That’s to be expected . The black lightning appears to have the power of random teleportation . Your brother must’ve teleported elsewhere . Otherwise, why would only the two of us teleport there despite the many cultivators around the island? If you search for him, you’ll find him eventually . ”

When the woman heard this, she felt relieved and her curiosity towards Han Li was piqued . His appearance was rather unfamiliar and she was certain that she had never seen him before . She tentatively guessed that he was a cultivator that had approached the island from a different direction .

She thought to ask more questions of Han Li, but she hesitated after realizing that they didn’t have a particularly close relationship, and ended up keeping silent .

As the two hurried after the group of green-robed people, she pondered about the pros and cons of inquiring about him further . Although they didn’t have any magic power, cultivators possessed bodies of purified essence that were far more capable than those of ordinary mortals .

Seeing that the two were able to follow after them without difficulty, a strange expression appeared in the lean man’s eyes, but instead of saying anything, he lowered his head and sped up .

The others behind him quickened their pace in response .

Han Li was somewhat surprised to see that these people were far more vigorous than ordinary mortals . Although their bodies didn’t seem to hold a superior level of inner strength, they clearly cultivated some shallow martial arts . It seemed that martial arts would prove quite useful here .

Nevertheless, Han Li still had misgivings from the ghost mist that had previously occurred .

From the records he had looked through, although the ghost fog was frightful, it had never been as disastrous as what had just occurred . There wasn’t even an opportunity for anyone to escape . Before he had even touched the ghost mist, the entirety of his magic power had already been sealed . It had been truly terrifying .

If each appearance of the ghost mist was that disastrous, then even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn’t be able to escape it . But in the previous appearances of the ghost mist, there were many cultivators who were able to escape from it, even low grade cultivators had .

However, Han Li felt somewhat suspicious about what the lean man had referred to as the so-called Spirit Extinguishing Qi . From its name, it was certain to have something to do with why his spiritual sense and magic power were currently restricted .

They were truly unlucky to have encountered such a particularly dreadful ghost mist that had managed to captured everyone present . He reckoned that those that survived the teleportation would be found scattered across the other corners of this land .

Just as Han Li thought this, the lean man suddenly stopped and turned his head in a different direction while the rest of his party had followed suit . Far off into the desert, a yellow dragon could be seen rushing towards them through surging clouds of sand .

“It’s Ah Hu and the others!” One of the youths shouted in delight as the others became excited . The lean man nodded his head and revealed a trace of relief, but his smile soon froze when he heard a series of sharp roars from the yellow dragon .

The lean man furiously yelled with a distorted expression, “Everyone, quickly go and help them! They are being pursued by umbra beasts . ” He took out the long white blade at his waist and led the charge forward .

The rest of the party came to a sudden realization and each of them brandished their blades as they followed suit .

Han Li stood in place, and merely stared at the yellow dragon in the distance with an odd expression .

The lean man’s party had just reached the yellow dragon when it abruptly stopped and roared before bursting into clouds of yellow mist .

The party loudly yelled as they entered the dense smoke, and shouts of all pitches and tones were intertwined . After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, their voices eventually quieted down .

After a short moment, a series of cheers came from within the yellow mist, and the men and woman all emerged with their bodies splattered with beast blood . It was difficult to tell if any of them had sustained any injuries, but each of them wore a smile of pleasant surprise .

When they returned, they were joined by the burly men that Han Li had seen within the mountain . They were still carrying the huge bags on their back .

When they spotted Han Li and Mei Ning, they appeared somewhat confused, but after the lean man whispered something to them, their expression brightened and paid them no further mind .

The group quickly marched on with the new arrivals . Two hours later, they had reached an expanse of pitch-black stone that interrupted the desolate sandscape .

Just like the desert from before, Han Li was unable to see the end of this expanse of black stone . However, the black stones were all strangely shaped and their deep shade of black left Han Li with an eerie feeling of discomfort .

But when the others saw this place, they let out long breaths of relief and wore relaxed expressions .

At that moment, the Yin clouds in the sky had begun to restlessly move about and the blue flashes of lightning had become more frequent . Occasionally, they would directly strike an area nearby, causing a pit to appear among the stones .

Han Li and Mei Ning were startled by the sudden turn of events, but the others seemed accustomed to it . They simply walked into the stony areas with quick strides .

The lean man then shouted, “Everyone, quicken your pace! The village is about to close their doors . Let’s avoid being trapped outside!” Afterwards, the group of people dashed forward and ran with all their might .

Han Li and Mei Ning glanced at each other . Although they didn’t know what was going on, they didn’t dare to fall behind .

Following their lead, the made several turns throughout the expanse of stone before suddenly arriving at an open area .

The spacious area had lofty stone walls that were as black as could be . Not only were these stone walls all carved out of massive boulders that were at least three meters wide and ten meters tall, but they extended out for several kilometers . Additionally, about every ten meters along the walls, a sharp spike of hardwood struck out from the wall, making for a sinister appearance .

Currently, the group of people were heading in the direction of an imposing wooden gate with over ten men with white pikes standing guard on either side .

When these guards saw the lean man’s party approach, they loudly yelled at them with excitement .

With a huge rumble, the gate slowly opened, allowing them inside .
