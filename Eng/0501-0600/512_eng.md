Chapter 512: Blackrock City

Yi Jing, the embroidered-robed man, swept his gaze around the room before looking at the Star Palace cultivator sitting in the corner . “It is somewhat inconvenient to speak here . Fellow Daoist Xu, how about we chat outside?”

“Outside? Sure . ” Xu Yun indifferently replied .

Yi Jing rejoiced, but he soon thought of something and turned his head around and widely smiled towards Han Li . “Brother Crooked Soul, wouldn’t it be better to come along with us and listen? Better yet, we can work together!”

Han Li blankly stared for a moment before smiling, “Alright, I did want to hear his explanation as well . ” Han Li then casually followed after them .

“What? That Fellow Daoist isn’t part of your group?” Xu Yun was quite surprised .

The dark-skinned, middle-aged man suddenly shouted out with a trace of hostility, “He did teleport along with us, but before that, we were strangers!”

Yi Jing frowned in response but didn’t say anything . Xu Yun wordlessly nodded .

After they all walked out of the stone room, the newcomers surveyed their surroundings with amazement . The scene was entirely different from what Han Li had seen on Deep Jade Island .

They emerged within a small market city . Although it appeared crude and only spanned about ten kilometers, the city was created entirely out of black stone . The shabby building that housed the transportation formation lay at the center of the city . It was propped up by a tall altar-like platform with steps descending from every side . Due to the height of the surrounding terrain, they were able to have a clear view of the surrounding city .

The city seemed to be surrounded by twelve meter tall stone walls along with a dense white sparkling barrier . However, there were tall buildings of varying sizes behind the walls . Strangely enough, none of them had pointed roofs; they were all flat .

At first glance, although the city was full of buildings, few of them were independently constructed . It wasn’t just a string of stone buildings joined together, but rather, frequent masses of stone buildings were lined up together .

What shocked Han Li the most was that a few mortals were mingling amongst the cultivators on the crude black stone road, occasionally rushing in and out of the stone buildings .

But this wasn’t enough to shock Han Li by itself; it was the fact that a majority of the mortals were young, beautiful women . As for the other mortals, they were burly men and delicate youths .

When Yi Jing’s party saw this, they were just as shocked as Han Li .

Since they wanted to travel to the Outer Star Seas, it was only natural to do research on the islands in advance . However, this scene was completely contrary to the information they had acquired .

A strange expression momentarily appeared on the Yi Jing’s face . He then said with a deep voice, “Fellow Daoist Liu, take another look at the jade slip containing information on Wondrous Depths Island . Could it be that we were mistaken?”

“I… I’ll take another look at it!” The woman surnamed Liu hastily looked through her storage pouch .

Xu Yun waved his arm and stopped the woman from finding the jade slip . “There is no need to look for the information on Wondrous Depths Island . Since most of it is false, it is natural to feel surprised . ”

Yi Jing’s expression changed, “False? What is that supposed to mean?”

“It is quite simple . Wondrous Depths Island is quite different from other demon beast islands . All cultivators are given a gag order prior to their return, allowing them to only leak certain information; else, they would suffer great punishment . It’s hard to say whether or not it will prove fortunate that you’ve arrived at this island . ”

“Certain information? Could it be due to the Star Palace?” Lady Liu appeared disturbed .

Xu Yun sighed and said, “It isn’t the Star Palace, but the various united powers that reign over this island . Even the Star Palace is unwilling to lightly offend this faction . ”

When those words were said Han Li raised his eyebrows while the others looked at each other in dismay .

Xu Yun chuckled and spoke with a loud, alluring tone, “Hehe! This place isn’t too different from what you’ve imagined . In fact, to some cultivators, it is a place they could only dream of . Blackrock City has the sole market and is the only city on Wondrous Depths Island . So long as you have spirit stones or demon cores, it is a cultivator’s paradise . You can purchase items that cannot be acquired from other demon beast islands . Regardless of whether it’s top grade cultivation vessels, formidable magic treasures, priceless spirit beasts, or exceedingly rare materials, this place has it all . ” The nearby cultivators and mortals glanced over due to his loud voice, but they soon averted their eyes and went on their way .

When Yi Jing heard this, he became especially bewildered . As for Han Li, he continued to look around with a calm expression as if he hadn’t heard what Xu Yun had said .

When Xu Yun saw this, he glanced at Han Li with slight surprise .

Yi Jing let out a long sigh and asked with a heavy voice, “Could Brother Xu give us an introduction of this place?”

Xu Yun seemed to have completely recovered from his low spirits and candidly said, “Of course I can . Since I can’t leave for the time being, how about I give you an explanation of the city while we stroll around? It should prove more useful than giving an empty explanation while standing in place . However, if anyone has any windfalls in the future, please don’t forget about me . ”

“Then I must thank you Brother Xu . This city appears quite different from others . ” Yi Jing then looked at a male cultivator with a trace of amazement . The cultivator was holding a mortal woman in his embrace in a bold display as they walked down the street, much to the disinterest of the other mortals and cultivators around them .

Xu Yun smiled when he saw this and didn’t say anything further . Instead, he brought them over to a large stone building .

The building had already caught Han Li’s attention as it was one of the largest in the city .

At a distance, he saw that two charming mortal women were standing at its entrance . As the many cultivators entered the building, they gave them a welcoming smile .

Along the way Xu Yun warned them with a solemn expression, “Bear this in mind! Although this isn’t Heavenly Star City, all magic battles are strictly forbidden apart from particular arenas . If this rule is violated, it will be punished by death without question . ”

The dark-skinned, middle-aged man spoke with shock, “What? This punishment is even more severe than Heavenly Star City’s!”

Xu Yin slowly explained, “True, it is far more severe . But like this, cultivators who enter the city may truly be at ease without having to worry . To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever managed to carry out their revenge and successfully leave the city alive . After all, there is a Nascent Soul Senior standing guard at all times . ”

“A Nascent Soul cultivator!” Yi Jing’s party all wore expressions of shock .

Han Li’s heart trembled violently and he became completely vigilant .

“Alright! Let’s hold off on any more questions until after we go inside . ” Underneath the smiles of the two beautiful mortal women, the party apprehensively followed Xu Yun into the building .

As for Han Li, a strange glint flickered from his eyes before he curiously followed them in .

After walking through the large entrance, a huge circular screen blocked their way . The screen was pink and had an image of a palace maid flying through the skies . Although the image of the woman was shown from behind, it appeared to be fluctuating as if she were truly in flight . From the faint pink light that the screen emitted, it couldn’t possibly be a low grade magic tool .

To the sides of the screen, there were two semi-circle doors . And to the front of the screen, there was a female cultivator who wore azure palace robes and appeared to be thirty-years old . She was happily chatting with a smiling male cultivator .

But strangely enough, despite her ordinary looks, each and everyone one of her movements were filled with a mature feminine charm . Additionally, the smile she wore as she spoke displayed a faintly seductive attraction .

Although she was a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator like the man she was speaking to, the man was completely enraptured by her .

However, when the woman caught sight of Xu Yun and the others, her eyes suddenly brightened and she clapped her hands, causing a young mortal girl to come out from behind a door . As the male cultivator was dragged behind the screen, he gazed at the female cultivator with a reluctant expression .
