Chapter 535: Trade Gathering

When Huang Mingli heard Han Li’s desire to depart, he agreed with an embarrassed smile . He then flew off to the east on his magic tool while Han Li leisurely followed after him with a calm expression .

As Huang Mingli flew, he turned his head to steal a glance at Han Li’s face, and carefully asked, “Senior’s face is quite unfamiliar . Have you been in secluded cultivation for a long time? Junior might’ve heard of your name before!”

Han Li casually said, “My surname is Li . I’ve remained in my cave residence for secluded cultivation until recently, when I finally formed my core . It isn’t surprising that Fellow Daoist Huang hadn’t heard of me before . ” Of course, Han Li didn’t give his real name .

The small old man didn’t notice anything amiss from Han Li, and could only speak words of congratulations despite still holding a few doubts in his heart .

Huang Mingli was quite tactful and didn’t further inquire about Han Li . Instead, he took the initiative to tell Han Li about a few of the recent confrontations between cultivators and demon beasts . However, from his deep sighs, it seemed the old man didn’t hold much hope towards humanity’s future in the Outer Star Seas .

Although the endless conversation was almost entirely one-sided, Han Li had gained a much greater understanding towards the current circumstances of the Outer Star Seas .

Nothing strange occurred in the following half month, allowing Han Li and the small old man to eventually spot a small, peaceful island in the distance . This island was only about fifty kilometers in area and possessed sparse amounts of spiritual Qi . Apart from a small growth of vegetation, the island only consisted of bare grey rock and appeared like any other desolate island .

It was an optimal location for a secret city . But even in that case, about half a day out, Han Li and the old man concealed their flight and approached the island under the guise of concealment techniques .

This, of course, was a requirement for entering the secret city .

When Huang Mingli beseeched him to conceal himself, Han Li silently complied without any complaint . This was a great relief to Huang Mingli as Core Formation cultivators weren’t always particularly easy to deal with in his experience .

Huang Mingli flew a circle around the small island before landing on a heap of rocks .

When Han Li saw this, a strange expression flickered from his eyes . If he wasn’t mistaken, there shouldn’t be any restrictions there . Could it be…?

As Han Li continued to mull this over, Huang Mingli stepped towards a large rock beside him and knocked three times on the stone with practiced familiarity . A short moment later, the huge rock suddenly split open to reveal a three meter wide hole .

Huang Mingli immediately stepped into the hole and softly said a few words into it . He then turned to Han Li and shouted, “Senior Li, it’s right here . Let’s go in!”

Han Li indifferently looked down and descended from the sky .

The hole led to a set of slanted stone stairs . To the side of the stairs stood a grey-robed, white-haired old man with a late Foundation Establishment cultivation .

Upon seeing Han Li enter, the old man smiled at him and spoke in a manner that was neither arrogant nor humble, “Senior, welcome to our market city . I hope Senior will be able to find what he needs . ”

“I hope so as well . ” Han Li calmly replied as he climbed down the stairs .

Han Li realized that in order to prevent any demon beasts from detecting spiritual Qi, formation spells couldn’t be established . As such, the only option left to maintain secrecy was building everything underground .

After walking down the stairs for a short time, Han Li’s eyes brightened .

There was an expansive underground world before him . The ceiling was twenty meters high with occasional pillars of transformed grey stone supporting it . There were many small square buildings at the center of the cavern, each sporting their own sign . There were over a hundred cultivators trading amongst these stone buildings .

At Han Li’s side, Huang Mingli pointed to a set of descending stairs beside a stone pillar and said, “Senior Li, this floor is only for trading ordinary items . If Senior wishes to acquire rare materials, it would be best to go down to the next floor . ”

Han Li glanced at the stone stairs, but didn’t move . He asked with a deep voice, “If I wanted information on the whereabouts of a high grade demon beast nest, where could I find it?”

Huang Mingli was obviously startled upon hearing this . A trace of confusion flickered from his eyes before he answered with great familiarity, “It would depend on what grade of demon beast Senior requires information about . If it’s grade five or six demon beasts, Senior can head over to the Wind Whisper Pavilion . They specialize in selling the whereabouts of difficult to acquire treasures and high grade demon beasts, allowing one to acquire them based on their own skill . However, they won’t have any information on demon beasts of a higher grade . In that case, your only option would be to ask other Core Formation Seniors . After all, the whereabouts of demon beasts of that grade aren’t easily divulged . Senior could participate in the trade gathering specifically for Core formation cultivators . Perhaps that is where Senior can find what he is looking for . ”

“Trade gathering?” Han Li’s expression revealed a trace of excitement .

Huang Mingli carefully explained, “That’s right! Normally, only other Core Formation cultivators have the materials and treasures that a Core Formation cultivator would need . As a result, every time the market city opens, the city lord will hold a meeting where Seniors gather together for a private, small-scale exchange, where they can trade for what they wish . The city lord would also take out several rare items for the meeting as well . ”

With a faint smile, Han Li slowly asked, “When does this trade gathering take place?”

The small old man promptly replied, “Senior Li will likely have to wait a few more days . I reckon around halfway through the opening of the market city, Senior will receive an invitation to join . ”

When Han Li heard this, he narrowed his eyes and wore a pensive expression as if he were thinking about it .

A short moment later, he glanced at Huang Mingli and spoke without restraint, “Fellow Daoist Huang, I plan on going the rest of the way alone so we’ll be parting ways here . I no longer require your assistance . ” Han Li didn’t wish to have someone following him around while he was searching for the Thousand Leaves Dew .

The small old man wasn’t particularly surprised by Han Li’s words . With a beaming smile, he said, “Senior’s words suits Junior’s intentions as well . Junior happens to want to go buy a few materials . Then I will bid you goodbye . If Senior requires any further assistance, then please do not hesitate to find me . ” Huang Mingli respectfully saluted Han Li and bid his farewells . He then headed into a nearby materials store . It seemed he wished to first sell off those demon breasts corpses from before .

Han Li was quite satisfied with how tactful and quick-witted the old man had behaved .

He swept his gaze past the nearby stores and walked into the store across from him with his arms behind his back . The first store he entered had piles of all sorts of medicinal ingredients . ……

Inside a quiet room, Han Li was resting with eyes closed . He felt somewhat gloomy .

During his first day in the market city, he had browsed both floors of the market city and found plenty of Demon Echo Grass but none that had grown near a grade eight demon beast . In addition, the Wind Whistle Pavilion didn’t have any information on demon beasts of grade seven or higher . He could only wait for when the trade gathering convened and see if any other Core Formation cultivators had relevant information .

In the following two days, he had no intention of heading out and rented a quiet room specifically to cultivate and see whether or not he could break through his current bottleneck . In the end, he had achieved nothing .

Thumps came from the door of his room . Although Han Li had anticipated this he still indifferently asked, “What is it?”

A woman’s pleasant voice respectfully said, “Senior Li! Junior is under orders to invite you to the trade gathering . Would Senior be interested in participating?”

Han Li slowly replied, “Yes, of course I am!” He then opened the stone door and walked out of the room .

There was a white clothed woman standing outside with a lowered head, respectfully waiting for him . When she saw Han Li appear, she immediately raised her head and revealed a charming face .

When Han Li saw the woman’s beautiful face, he felt his heart tremble . After staring at the woman’s face, a flicker of astonishment appeared within his eyes .

‘How could it be her? What is she doing here?’ Han Li thought, astonished .

The woman saw Han Li staring at her, causing her to blush . She then lowered her head and uncomfortably asked, “Senior, is something wrong?”

Han Li quickly regained his bearings and calmly said, “It’s nothing . Lead the way . ”

The white clothed woman faintly felt that something was amiss, but she respectfully agreed and walked away with calm steps .

Gazing at the woman’s silhouette, Han Li unconsciously frowned and wore a face full of confusion .

Passing through the plaza of the second floor, the woman brought Han Li to a remote stone wall .

The woman gently pressed her hand against the wall, creating ripples of white light and revealing a stone door covered in talisman characters .
