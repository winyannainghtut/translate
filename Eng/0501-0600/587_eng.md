Han Li frowned for a moment before calmly saying, “Fellow Daoist Mei, since we arrived here together, it could be considered that there is some destiny between us . Since Lady Mei already mentioned it, I won’t conceal it any longer . I feel that I am somewhat able to climb Stormwind Mountain . Regardless of whether it’s the flying umbra beasts that circle the mountain or the hallucinogenic mist, I have methods of dealing with them . However, these methods will only work for me alone . I do not have the skill to bring along anyone else as I would only be able to take care of myself when danger approaches . Fellow Daoist Mei would be certain to die . Since you are so young, it would be better to stay here . Perhaps there will be another opportunity to leave in the future!”

The final sentence was supposed to comfort her, but when Han Li heard himself say it, he couldn’t help but feel that it sounded quite artificial . However, he had been speaking the truth .

Mei Ning’s face instantly paled and she bit her lips in silence .

When Han Li saw the woman turn silent, he sighed and closed his eyes once more .

To tell the truth, he didn’t have a bad impression of Mei Ning . Were she capable enough, he may have provided assistance . But as of right now, Han Li couldn’t afford to increase the burden to himself . He could only still his heart and leave the woman behind . Fortunately, even if she was left behind in the Umbra Realm, she wouldn’t have too difficult a life . At worst, her path of Immortal cultivation had come an end . He didn’t have anything to feel guilty about!

The room settled into silence . After an unknown amount of time passed, Han Li believed that the woman was crestfallen . When he was about to drift off to sleep, he suddenly heard her say, “If I can temporarily restore a bit of your magic power, would you be able to bring me out?”

“What?” Han Li’s eyes shot open and he stared at the woman with disbelief . His sleepiness had completely disappeared .

Mei Ning had her hands wrapped around her knees as she sat on the bed . Her face turned to the side as if she hadn’t spoken .

Just as Han Li was doubting whether or not he had misheard, the woman stretched her body out and raised her head with determination clear in her eyes . “I have a method to temporarily restore a bit of magic power to Brother Han . Although it will last only a moment, it should be of great assistance when Han Li climbs the mountain . However, in addition to taking me away from this land, I have another condition for my assistance . ”

After Mei Ning said this, her expression appeared strange, causing Han Li to feel slight doubt .

Han Li stared at the woman and spoke with a heavy tone, “It’s not that I don’t believe you, but even a Nascent Soul cultivator was trapped here, incapable of restoring his abilities . Is Fellow Daoist Mei joking?”

At that moment, his expression was filled with doubt, but it also contained a trace of hope . If he could temporarily restore his magic power, his odds of escaping would be almost certain . Even if it was only a small bit of magic power for a short amount of time, it would be more than enough .

His storage pouch had several threads that didn’t need spiritual power to activate . With their wondrous powers, his safety would be further guaranteed .

As for his spirit beast pouches, although the Gold Devouring Beetles and the Bloodjade Spider require spiritual sense to control, he would just barely be able to use the Weeping Soul Pearl within his body to control the Weeping Soul Beast . Although those Umbra Beasts weren’t malicious spirits, they were condensed from umbra Qi, something reminiscent of Yin Qi . They should at least be easily restrained, and wouldn’t pose much of a threat to him .

With that thought, Han Li grew excited .

With a hesitant expression, Mei Ning whispered, “Although this little woman doesn’t have mutated spiritual roots or heavenly spiritual roots, I possess the Transient Jade Phoenix Marrow constitution . Brother Han should know what this means . Through a secret technique, I will be able to give Brother Han my Transient Spirit Qi . The Transient Spirit Qi is extremely pure spiritual power, and will be able to ward off the Spirit Extinguishing Qi for a moment . Of course, the Transient Spiritual Qi will eventually scatter, and Fellow Daoist will once again be without any magic power . ”

“Transient Jade Phoenix Marrow constitution!” Han Li was stunned for a moment . But soon after, he started to examine the woman with a strange gaze as his face revealed a trace of understanding .

Mei Ning slowly said, “That’s right . If Fellow Daoist doubts me, he may examine me to know that my words aren’t false . ” At the same time, a slight blush arose from her face .

“The you must excuse me . ” After a moment of hesitation, Han Li stood up and walked over . With something so important, he had no choice but to make certain .

At that moment, Mei Ning forced herself to be calm as she rolled up her sleeve, revealing her arm . The arm actually had a spot of gecko cinnabar on it .

[TL: gecko cinnabar is supposed to tell whether or not someone is a virgin . ]

As Han Li watched, the woman clenched her teeth and she lightly pressed her thumb onto the spot before quickly releasing it .

Han Li’s heart stirred as he watched from the bedside . He saw the spot of gecko cinnabar gradually fade away to reveal a silver phoenix pattern . The flowing brilliance made it appear astonishingly lifelike .

Han Li muttered in delighted surprise, “So this is the Transient Jade Spirit Phoenix!”

“Fellow Daoist should now know that I spoke truthfully . ” Mei Ning glanced at Han Li to confirm that he had seen it and hastily rolled down her sleeve with a flushed expression .

Han Li nodded his head and silently returned to his seat as he started to think .

Although she cannot be compared to those with extraordinary spiritual roots, she still possessed a rare constitution that was rarely seen even once every hundred years . It’s presence was to be celebrated in the cultivation world and everyone knew of its existence .

Although only female cultivators could possess this constitution and it didn’t provide any assistance on the path of cultivation, they would be in great demand by many male cultivators . This was because once the woman entered late Foundation Establishment stage, her body would produce a strand of pure Transient Spirit Qi .

This Transient Spirit Qi was known to be one of the seven pure spiritual powers in the world . While it was of no use to a woman, it could easily cleanse a man’s essence and allow their cultivation to greatly progress .

Of course, while this essence cleansing effect was of lesser value to higher grade cultivators, it was still comparable to ancient rare medicinal pills .

However, this Transient Spirit Qi was something that could only be passed to a man willingly . There was no way to forcefully extract it from her by using a secret technique . Furthermore, in her entire lifetime, she would only be able to give the Transient Spirit Qi once . She won’t be able to produce more of the spirit Qi for the rest of her life . Additionally, if she lost her maidenhood before the Transient Spirit Qi was transmitted, it would vanish .

Han Li had previously browsed through records that were related to this matter . After recalling them, Han Li felt that if he acquired this spirit Qi, it could be possible that he’d be able to use a bit of magic power . After all, Transient Spirit Qi was one of the seven pure spirit Qi’s in the world . At the very least, it should allow him access to his storage and spirit beast pouches . With that thought, Han Li raised his head and swept his gaze to the beautiful woman, calmly asking, “Lady Mei, could you tell me your other condition?”

After some hesitation, Mei Ning resolutely said, “It’s simple . I wish for Brother Han to find my elder brother and bring him out of the Umbra Realm . ”

After some consideration, Han Li shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that I will only be able to meet that condition halfway . ”

“Halfway?” Mei Ning wore a strange expression . It was clear she didn’t understand what he meant by this .

“Yes . There is another reason why I can’t remain in the Umbra Realm for too long . As such, I can only agree to do my utmost and spend three months searching for your brother . If I am not able to find him within that time, then I will have to set off immediately . ”

After some thought, and feeling that Han Li wouldn’t budge on this matter, she nodded her head and agreed, “Three months! This place isn’t that large . You should be able to find him in that time . Alright, I accept . ”

Han Li smiled at her frank acceptance . Mei Ning then stared at Han Li and slowly said, “Although I’ve only known you for a short while, I don’t believe that I’ve misjudged you . As such, to prove to you that I intend to keep my word, I will give you the Transient Spirit Qi whenever you ask . If Brother Han wishes for it now, then I will not hesitate to give it to you . ”
