Chapter 521: Savage Flood Dragon

‘Savage Flood Dragon!’ Han Li inwardly shouted with an expression of rarely-seen fear .

This scarlet demon beast had a body that stretched out to four hundred meters and appeared similar to the the inky flood dragon that he had seen before . Furthermore, it was one of the more fearsome types of flood dragons amongst its kind . Judging by the congealed essence that was displayed by the light wandering across its scarlet scales, it appeared to be a genuine grade eight demon beast . The demon beast emitted a pressure that Han Li had only experienced from Nascent Soul cultivators .

Flood dragons were one of the few primordial demon beasts that remained in this world since the ages of antiquity . Not only did these demon beasts cultivate far faster than others, but their magic power would also greatly exceed that of other demon beasts of similar ranking . It wasn’t impossible for a flood dragon to even defeat an opponent that was of a superior grade .

If what the ancient records said was true, then the grade eight Savage Flood Dragon should be an equal match for average grade nine demon beasts .

This knowledge caused Han Li to turn pale from shock . He immediately wanted to run, but he still managed to retain enough reason to not make any rash movements . There were still two more streaks of light flying across the sky towards them . It seemed they came with hostile intentions since they were flying over without the slightest attempt at concealment .

As these developments occurred, Han Li placed the blood red cloak on his body as stealthily as possible . At the same time, he also summoned the Five Element Bands and the flower basket into his hands . With these at the ready, Han Li felt far more at ease .

By this point, the Savage Flood Dragon had already let out a long hiss . It turned its long head towards the huge turtle resisting the lightning with all its strength, watching it with a strange expression .

Soon, the flood dragon’s body emitted a frightening blue light, causing his body to suddenly shrink .

After only a short moment, the flood dragon’s body had assumed a form that was close in size and shape to a human .

Its head was still that of a fierce flood dragon, but its limbs appeared to be that of a human, apart from the scarlet scales that covered its body . It also had a thick scaly tail that continuously whipped around .

The flood dragon’s transformation left Han Li dumbstruck .

The flood dragon stood idly on top of the raging seas as if he were standing on land, not swaying in the slightest .

However, after he transformed, his eyes unconsciously swept towards Han Li’s direction, and its gaze became icy . Han Li suddenly felt his body break out into a chill as he tightly grabbed onto his ancient treasures with sweaty palms .

Fortunately, the golden light and red brilliance had just arrived during that time .

The Savage Flood Dragon immediately lost interest in Han Li as its cold gaze swept past the three people that had appeared before it .

The golden light was revealed to be an old Daoist with the appearance of a sage . He carried a saber on his back and a horsetail whisk in his hand and wore a brilliant gold Daoist’s robe containing the eight trigrams . He twirled his beard as he examined the human form of the flood dragon . While his face showed shock, his eyes surprisingly contained a trace of greed .

Not far away from the old Daoist stood two middle-aged men with identical appearances . Their skin appeared as ashen as corpse’s and they wore brilliant fire-red robes . The only difference between them that Han Li could distinguish was that one of them held a three-meter-long ghost head staff, while the other wore a massive red gourd on their back .

They first glanced at the huge turtle beneath them before turning their eyes to the Savage Flood Dragon and the old Daoist . They were both silent and expressionless .

The old man appeared to only possess an early Nascent Soul cultivation, and the two middle-aged men appeared to only be late Core Formation cultivators . But Han Li was baffled to see that the two red-robed middle-aged man were able to face the immense pressure from both the flood dragon and the old Nascent Soul Daoist without showing the slightest fear .

After the old man’s eyes wandered several times around the two, he suddenly smiled at them and said, “Hehe! I didn’t think that I’d encounter the Huo Brothers . This humble Daoist apologizes for not recognizing you sooner!”

The face of the red-robed man with the gourd on his back twitched . He then expressionlessly said, “We also didn’t expect to find Senior Jin Xia here . If Senior wishes to exterminate the two demon beasts beneath us, we would be glad to work together . ”

When the old Daoist heard this, he felt gloomy .

The flood dragon was an existence that was equivalent to a grade nine demon beast . He wasn’t so arrogant to believe that he could handle it alone . Were it not for the confidence he held in his incisive magic treasures, he wouldn’t even consider fighting it .

After the old Daoist frowned, he dryly coughed several times before bluntly saying, “You Fellow Daoists must be joking . This humble Daoist wouldn’t be able to deal with the Savage Flood Dragon by himself . Likewise, neither could the two of you restrain it . But together, we might have a chance at success . Perhaps you Fellow Daoists would be interested in giving it a try? It’s been quite a while since a grade eight demon beast has been seen . If we were to join hands, we might be able to luckily succeed . In that case, I will only require the flood dragon’s soul . I have no need of its demon core . ” Daoist Jin Xia stared at the two red-robed men as he spoke .

The old Daoist’s words seemed to run contrary to the two red-robed men’s expectations . But after they glanced at each other, clearly communicating through some unknown method, the middle-aged man holding the ghost head staff briefly nodded and replied, “Fine! We’ll agree to Senior’s conditions . Us Juniors don’t wish to relinquish this opportunity and will strive our hardest!”

When that was said, his companion had already taken the fire-red gourd into his hand .

When the old Daoist heard this, he rejoiced . He raised his arm and flung out an azure jade ring from his sleeve . It flew downwards, leaving a strange cry in its wake .

The Savage Flood Dragon stared coldly at the three as if it understood their words . A fierce expression flickered from his face as he opened his mouth, shooting a beam of scarlet light towards the old Daoist . Its silhouette then flickered and disappeared from sight .

In the following moment, the Savage Flood Dragon re-appeared behind the two red-robed men in a flash . With fingers wrapped in blue light, it fiercely swiped its claws down to be met with a clang .

The ghost head staff in one of their hands had automatically taken the shape of a three-meter-tall malevolent spirit, and blocked the strike, saving their lives .

When this occurred, the brothers surnamed Huo were greatly frightened . Their stiff, corpse-like faces were now overwhelmed with shock .

At that same moment, the large red gourd lightly shook . With a howl of wind, countless grains of red crystal rushed out of the gourd, enveloping an area of over three hundred meters turning it into a realm of blazing fire and trapping the Savage Flood Dragon within it .

As for the scarlet ray of light that the flood dragon had released, it was currently tangling with the old Daoist’s jade ring as if it were alive .

The old Daoist’s expression was quite solemn and he did his utmost to prevent the scarlet light from nearing his body . He knew that the scarlet light was not to be underestimated .

The Savage Flood Dragon was suppressing the two late Core Formation cultivators in a clear attempt to allow the demon tortoise to finish its tribulation .

Conversely, the old Daoist and the red-robed man feared the escape of the Savage Flood Dragon and rejoiced at every bit of magic power that the demon beast wasted . It would save them quite a bit of trouble later on . As for the huge tortoise, even if its tribulation was completed, its Origin Qi would be greatly damaged, and it wouldn’t pose much of a threat .

As such, the three cultivators continued their fight with the demon beast in the sky as the huge tortoise beneath them reached the key moment of its tribulation . The bolts of lightning falling from the sky began to form silver spheres of lightning . Each strike caused the huge tortoise to tremble and was met with wild roars .

Han Li rejoiced at the sight .

Naturally, he had no thoughts to take advantage of the situation . A battle at this level was beyond what he could handle . But either way, regardless of which side won, it would be more than enough to solve Han Li’s cave residence predicament .

As of now, an elusive opportunity for escape had finally showed itself . Han Li immediately made use of it, immersing the blood-red cape with his magic power and tearing through the sky as a streak of blood-red light .

Han Li’s sudden appearance and show of speed had caused both the cultivators and the flood dragon to become alarmed, but they soon ignored him .

This was because they were able to perceive that Han Li’s cultivation was quite shallow despite traveling at such a fast speed . An early Core Formation cultivator would prove insignificant to all of them .

As Han Li was fearful of the demon beasts and cultivators discovering his cave residence, he decided to fly in a direction away from the sea mist .

With the blood-red cloak’s astonishing speed, Han Li was able to travel several thousands of kilometers in moments . After seeing that there were no pursuers, he finally relaxed and flew without his cloak as he went on ahead .

After flying for the greater part of a day, Han Li casually sought an island to stay on for the time being .

Several days later, Han Li reckoned that the battle should’ve reached a conclusion, and he carefully flew back .

As expected, the sea nearby the mist was completely tranquil with no demon beasts, cultivators, or heavenly lightning in sight as if nothing had occurred .

Han Li floated above the nearby seas and muttered to himself for a moment before slowly releasing his spiritual sense into the nearby seas . His body then suddenly blurred with a flash of azure light as he dived into the sea . In the time it took to finish a meal, Han Li emerged, holding something in each of his hands .
