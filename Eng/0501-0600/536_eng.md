Chapter 536: A Display of Women

“Senior Li, please enter!” The woman pushed the stone door open and respectfully invited Han Li inside .

Han Li nodded and walked in without another word as the woman closely followed after him . The stone door then closed by itself and disappeared, returning the wall to its previous unremarkable appearance .

After entering, Han Li saw a grey stone passageway that didn’t appear very long based on the white light he saw faintly shining at the end .

Han Li silently walked forward and made a turn at the end of the passage, suddenly facing a wide open stone door . There was a gloomy middle-aged, mid Core Formation cultivator standing outside the doorway .

When he saw Han Li appear, he immediately smiled and said, “So you’re Fellow Daoist Li? I am Yun Tianxiao, the master of the city . Welcome to my trade meeting . Nearly all of the fellow Daoists have already arrived . ” The Confucian scholar surnamed Yun was very courteous to Han Li . He then indifferently turned to the woman and said, “Young Lady Wen, properly attend to Brother Li . Make sure not to neglect him!”

‘Fellow Daoist Wen?’

There was no longer any doubt regarding the woman’s identity . She was Wen Qiang’s daughter, the Exquisite Sound Sect’s Wen Siyue1 . Just what had happened for her to appear at this place?

It had caused Han Li no small amount of amazement . Naturally, since he had used the Appearance Exchange Arts, the woman was unable to recognize him .

When Wen Siyue heard him, her flowery expression changed and she hastily acknowledged him .

Although Han Li didn’t turn around, he could faintly perceive that Wen Siyue was very fearful of Yun Tianxiao .

A strange expression flickered within Han Li’s eyes, but he merely smiled and casually said a few words of formality before entering .

The door let to a large square hall with a huge round table at its center . The table had over a dozen remarkably wide armchairs surrounding it . Most of the chairs were already occupied by other cultivators .

But when Han Li clearly saw the circumstances in the room, he wore a baffled expression .

Apart from two female Core Formation cultivators that were sitting alone, the male Core Formation cultivators were each nestled together with a gorgeous and alluring female cultivator . These female cultivators were either at peak Qi Condensation or early Foundation Establishment, and each of them were all young exceptional beauties .

While Han Li looked at this in a daze, he suddenly smelled a sweet fragrance, and a soft, trembling body stood close by his side . Han Li’s body tensed up and he slowly turned around to see a stiff, beautiful face . Wen Siyue had taken the initiative to draw closer to him, allowing him to catch a whiff of her intoxicating scent .

Han Li frowned, but he didn’t push away the woman in an act of false sophistry . Instead, he again glanced at the female cultivators at the male Core Formation cultivator’s sides with a gaze of understanding .

After some thought, he wrapped his arm around the woman’s waist and headed towards an empty armchair before sitting down .

Wen Siyue did the same as the other female cultivators, and reluctantly sat alongside him while leaning into Han Li’s chest .

For the moment, Han Li’s chest had the warm company of a beautiful woman .

Just as Wen Siyue silently pressed her stiffened body against Han Li, Han Li relaxed the arm he had wrapped around her waist . Wen Siyue was stunned for a moment . She then unconsciously glanced at Han with a trace of bewilderment .

At that moment, Han Li was calmly examining the others in the room .

The eight other Core Formation cultivators had naturally gazed in Han Li’s direction as well .

Although they found Han Li’s appearance strange, they didn’t reveal it on their faces . Instead, most of the people looked at Han Li with a kind smile . Han Li’s expression relaxed and he returned the gesture .

A short momenter later, six more Core Formation cultivators entered the hall, each with a young, beautiful female cultivator at their side .

Han Li watched this with an ordinary expression, but his heart felt amazement .

Yun Tianxiao must’ve possessed significant skill to have found so many young and beautiful female cultivators . All of their cultivations weren’t shallow either but they were still at varying levels .

Just as Han Li pondered this, Yun Tianxiao finally entered the hall with a graceful and elegant beauty wrapped around his arm . The woman was at late Foundation Establishment Stage .

‘Lady Fan!’ Han Li heart was shaken upon seeing her .

‘She is the Exquisite Sound Sect’s Envoy of the Right, Lady Fan . It seems she has a somewhat deep relationship with the city master . This trade gathering should prove to be quite interesting . ’ Despite his excitement and the expectations in his heart, Han Li was able to maintain his calm expression .

“Ah!” Wen Siyue faintly trembled next to Han Li . A faint, painful groan left her dainty mouth . It sounded as if it contained flustered embarrassment .

Han Li was stunned for a moment and couldn’t help but puzzlingly glance at her . He found her face to be flushed red and bashful .

He also discovered that his arm had unknowingly grasped onto her chest . He even felt his fingers pinching onto something stiff and round .

This soft, overwhelming sensation shook the depths of Han Li’s soul . He immediately withdrew his hand out of instinct .

Wen Siyue’s smooth, delicate neck was now flushed red . She hesitantly raised her head and gazed at Han Li’s face with a trace of astonishment .

A trace of discomfort faintly appeared on Han Li’s face, but he pretended not to notice, relaxing the arm he had around her .

Although he had never thought of himself as a man of honor, this woman could be considered an acquaintance, causing Han Li to be somewhat embarrassed .

Han Li discovered that this strange display wasn’t noticed by anybody else in the room . Their attention had been captured by Yun Tianxiao who had already sat in the main chair with Lady Fan gracefully poised at his side .

Yun Tianxiao widely smile and said, “I am truly honored to have you thirteen Fellow Daoists participate in this trade meeting . Although there were two Fellow Daoists that had to leave early, this trade meeting is already the largest one yet . That is about all I have to say . Everyone can now take out their items . Give your items a brief introduction, and then, everyone can start bidding or offer an exchange . Accept whatever offer pleases you . ”

He then turned his head to the fat, blue-robed old man and smiled . He was clearly indicating for him to start .

As of current, the fat old man was closely embracing the body of a dainty female cultivator . Upon seeing Yun Tianxiao’s smile, he reluctantly relaxed his grip on her waist and leisurely said, “Since this is the case, I will start . I’ve brought quite a few good items this time around . I am more than willing to exchange them for any of the materials that I require . ” After that was said, the old man stood up and placed a storage pouch from his waist onto the table .

Numerous items suddenly appeared on the table in a vortex of spinning red light . The spiritual Qi that the items emitted appeared significant .

“Three Heavenly Spirit Beads, an Ambusher Shark demon core, the hide of an Oceanform Beast…” The old man gave a proud introduction for each of his items, impressing no small number of the cultivators at the table . It was clear that each of these items were quite rare .

Han Li couldn’t help but coldly smile at the items . While these items could be considered truly valuable to ordinary Core formation cultivators, they were completely unremarkable to him . The rarest item amongst them, the Ambusher Sharp demon core, was only a grade six demon core . Han Li had personally exterminated at least eight demon beasts of that specific type .

When the fat old man finished giving an introduction to his items, he sat back down and once again embraced the dainty woman at his side . He had a face full of arrogance .

The Qi Condensation woman was originally somewhat unwilling to be held by him, but now, her eyes unconsciously glowed with a soft light .

After the old man sat down, the person who sat next to him, an eccentric with a red embroidered headband, dryly coughed and unsteadily stood . This person was rather shriveled and appeared as if a stiff breeze would blow him over .

“I’ve only brought one item . The beast egg of the grade five Darkcoil Worm . ” He spoke unhurriedly and took out a yellow beast egg from his robes shortly after he finished speaking . It was the size of a chicken egg .

“Darkcoil Worm!”

Once the eccentric had finished speaking, the eyes of the other cultivators brightened, and they rigidly stared at the demon beast egg with fervent gazes .

Wen Qiang was a Qi Condensation cultivator that met Han Li at Stalwart Star Island . Han Li met him once again many years later along with his daughter in chapter 430 . *
