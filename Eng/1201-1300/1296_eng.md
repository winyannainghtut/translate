Chapter 1296: Spirit Lord Huang Liang

Han Li examined the spirit tools materials in various stores, passing through at least eight of them but finding nothing to his liking . He let out an inward sigh .

The materials in these stores weren’t bad, some could definitely be considered high quality . But with Han Li’s Vajra Arts about to reach its peak, these materials wouldn’t prove very useful to him . If he used them to refine a spirit tool, they would only amount to the level of the golden wyrm sword he made for the fat merchant .

It just wouldn’t be useful for him .

Looking at Han Li with a probing gaze, the skinny man Tian Xing quickly asked, “What? Were those materials not good enough for Brother Han?”

“I have no use for those materials . ” Han Li shook his head, making no effort to hide his disappointment .

“If they aren’t good enough for you, then I will bring you to another place . There are a few peculiar items there . However, I won’t guarantee it will have what you want . ” Worthy of being a local, Tian Xing immediately thought of another place .

“Oh? Go ahead . ” When Han Li heard this, his interest was piqued .

The two left the street and fetched a beast carriage .

But just as Han Li set foot on it, he suddenly heard a dragon’s roar in the sky, followed by a tiger's cry .

Those two sounds overlapped and spread through the nearby air, causing an uproar amongst mortals and cultivators alike .

Han Li’s attention also turned to the source of the sound .

Han Li quickly saw a black dot shooting around in the air, quickly arriving above him .

It was a strange three-headed beast with one tiger and one dragon head . It pulled a faint azure carriage quickly through the air . The sounds of the beast quickly faded into the distance .

“Spirit Lord Huang Liang left his cave residence . How is that possible?” Tian Xing cried out .

“Who is that person?” Han Li asked .

Tian Xing was startled by Han Li’s question and couldn't help but examine Han Li with an odd gaze .

Han Li blinked and chuckled, “What? Could it be a flower bloomed on my face?”

“It appears that Brother Han has come from a place far away . ”

“You mean to say this person is quite famous in Setting Sun City?” Han Li frowned .

Tian Xing excitedly explained, “Although the city master is a mid Deity Transformation-stage cultivator, the strongest cultivator isn’t him, but rather, Spirit Lord Huang Liang who lived in a nearby mountain for over ten thousand years . It is said that he is at the stage where he merged five elements, an early Void Refinement-stage cultivator . ”

“Void Refinement stage!” Han Li’s heart trembled .

When he became a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator, Han Li came to understand the huge gap between Deity Transformation-stage and Void Refinement-stage . In the past few decades in the spirit realm, the high grade of cultivation he heard of was the Integration stage . The three human sovereigns were examples that completed that realm of cultivation .

From what he heard from mortals and other cultivators, he never heard any rumors of Great Ascension or ascension tribulation .

It was as if the highest grade existences in the spirit realm never made an appearance .

Of course, it was possible, he was interacting with the lower rungs of society where such information was sparse .

After they boarded the beast carriage, Tian Xing excitedly gave Han Li some information regarding Spirit Lord Huang Liang, but most of it was regarding his grand reputation .

Han Li listened to it with a smile but said nothing in response .

As a result, the carriage rushed through the city for several hours before suddenly stopping at the end of an unfamiliar street .

Han Li leaped off the carriage and looked around him to find a large store .

The store appeared uncommon .

The door was rather tall and was decorated with provocative gold colors . The words Sky World Pavilion was written on its sign .

The sides of the door were two three-meter-tall iron pillars . There were silver chains that chained red lizard-like creatures to the pillars .

The two creatures immediately stood up when they saw Han Li descend from the carriage and they looked at him with a hostile gaze .

“Let’s go!” Tian Xing looked at the beasts without much care, and fished out a yellow tile, waving it at the two beasts .

The two lizards then let out a strange roar and lazily crouched back on the ground, allowing the two to pass .

When Han Li arrived inside, he unconsciously frowned .

There was only a simple room that spanned over two hundred meters side . Although a few goods were on display, most of the place was empty .

At the corner of the room, there was a staircase with a chair next to it . A sickly old man with a drooping nose sat on it, half asleep as if he weren’t expecting any guests .

“Old Xu, wake up! I brought a customer!” Tian Xing bluntly walked several steps forward and shook the old man’s shoulder .

“A customer? Where?” The old man lazily opened his eyes, appearing only half-awake .

Han Li examined the old shopkeeper and calmly said, “I heard this store had a few peculiar items so I thought to take a look . ”

The shopkeeper’s gaze focused on Han Li for a long while before he broke out in a smile, “The customer wants peculiar items? That will be easy . This shop specializes in unordinary items, selling them to those who need them . What are you looking for?”

“Spirit tool materials!” Han Li calmly said .

“Yi! We don’t get many of those . However, I do have two such items . Do you want me to fetch them?” The shopkeeper smiled and then walked up the staircase .

When Han Li looked at the shopkeeper’s back, Han Li narrowed his eyes and said, “This person seems to be a body refiner and an accomplished one at that!”

Tian Xing explained, “Of course . Old Xu was a famous high-grade body refiner in the past . But a few decades ago, he encountered mishaps in the Setting Sun Tomb . There was a ferocious poison that sapped away all the strength in his body . All he could do was open this shop . ”

“So it was like that!” Han Li nodded in recognition .

Tian Xing smiled and thought to ask Han Li about what he thought of the old man when suddenly they heard a beast snarl, followed by a shout, “Beasts! You’re courting death!”

Two muffled thuds sounded as if something heavy landed .

Han Li and Tian Xing astonishedly turned around to find a man and a woman standing outside . The two beasts standing guard were lying motionlessly on their backs .

Tian Xing yelled out in alarm, but when he heard the beasts whimper, he sighed in relief .

Han Li glanced at the pair that arrived .

Both the man and the woman appeared young . The man was handsome and dignified, while the woman was gorgeous; together they appeared to be a lovely couple . And, they released a spiritual pressure that was quite powerful, signifying that the two were Core Formation-stage cultivators .

With Han Li’s sight, he was able to tell at a glance that they were about as young as they looked .

With such dense spiritual Qi in the spirit realm and the addition of large quantities of treasures and high-grade spirit stones, it was far easier to achieve Foundation Establishment and Core Formation than it was in the mortal realm . However, it was still astonishing that such young people could possess that level of cultivation .

When the man saw Han Li and Tian Xing, he swept his spiritual sense past them to find one of them a Qi Condensation cultivator . He harshly yelled, “Are you the shop attendants?” His words and face contained obvious pride .

As for the ring Han Li wore on his finger, it revealed he was a body refiner, but the youth was disinclined to speak with a body refiner that associated with a Qi Condensation cultivator .

Tian Xing sensed the two were Core Formation cultivators and hastily wore an ingratiating smile, “No . This Junior is only a guest that has come on business . ”

“You’re customers? Then where is the shopkeeper!” The youth asked with a snort .

“Old Xu is upstairs fetching something . He will attend to you in a moment . ” Tian Xing carefully replied .

The youth paid no heed Tian Xing and turned to the young woman at his side . He said with a warm tone, “Junior Martial Sister Lu, we’ll have to wait for a moment . Is that fine?”

“It is no problem . I reckon that my grandfather is currently speaking with the master . There is no need to rush and bother them . However, does this place truly possess what we want?” The gorgeous woman looked around, curious about the empty shelves on display .

“This is also my first time coming to this shop . According to my friend, this shop truly has rare and fantastical items . Even if we can’t find what you’re looking for, we may see something interesting . ” The young man spoke to her with a fawning tone .

“Since Senior Martial Brother Qian said that, I will definitely take a look . ” The young woman chuckled .

At that moment, footsteps sounded from above . The old man slowly descended while holding two decorated boxes .

“Oh? More customers have come . ” The old man was surprised to see the two, but when he looked outside, his face sank, “Yi! It seems you’ve injured my guard beasts . ”

“Don’t worry! I’ve only taught them a lesson . There is no risk to their life . Junior Martial Sister Lu is a descendant of Senior Huang Liang . Your guard beasts truly alarmed her, so I had no choice . ” The youth seemed to know the shopkeeper’s origins, but his body remained still and his face still calm .

“So she’s a descendant of the Spirit Lord . I will overlook this only once!” The old man’s expression faintly changed and his expression remained normal .

Soon after, he was disinterested in continuing to speak with the two and he walked towards Han Li and presented the boxes to him .

Without reaching for the boxes, a glint flashed from Han Li’s eyes and he asked, “How about Shopkeeper Xu give me an introduction to these two items . They appear quite odd . ”
