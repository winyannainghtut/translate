Chapter 1274: Temporary Departure

A calm man’s voice spoke from the city gate, “By command of the city lord, we will assist Officer Zhao . We will naturally offer our services . ”

A white-robed Confucian scholar and a monk of azure Buddhist robes walked out from the city gate . The voice belonged to the scholar .

Officer Zhao didn’t dare to neglect the cultivators and hurriedly thanked them with a smile .

The scholar took out a mirror while the monk took out an alms bowl . After a brief chant and incantation gesture, they tossed the magic tools into the air .

Suddenly, the magic tools began to circle in the air . The lens spouted out an azure mist, covering an entire tortoise . As for the alms bowl, it released a yellow light and began to sweep past the wolf cavalrymen .

In a short span of time, the light from both the magic tools quickly swept through the entire caravan, thoroughly scanning each person present .

In the blink of an eye, the thirty carriages and two hundred people were inspected without a problem found .

“Good, you can all enter the city . Ah yes, I must tell you something . Mistress Fang has already made a contract with the largest inn in the eastern city, the Cloud Ease Inn . You may head there after you deliver your goods . ” Officer Zhao’s expression relaxed and he didn’t make matters more difficult . After having his say, he waved his hand and signaled them to enter .

Zhang Kiu saluted him before leading the caravan into the city .

After passing through the gates, Han Li discovered that the city was far larger than he expected .

At a glance, the city had an innumerable amount of buildings . He couldn't see the end of them . In addition, the city was well planned when it was constructed . Although the buildings were of different styles and materials used to build them were highly varied, they were evenly arranged with ten meter wide stone roads lined between them .

Such a large city was naturally bustling with excitement . The streets were filled with people where it was nearly overcrowded .

Han Li was stunned at the scene, but he soon discovered most of the people on the streets carried a weapon on them and wore heavy expressions .

When the blue-robed woman in the carriage saw this, she sighed and muttered, “It seems the matter about the beast torrent is true . Otherwise, the villagers outside wouldn’t have all rushed into the city . There is a large pressure on An Yuan City . ”

When Han Li heard this, he came to a sudden realization .

With so many people, it would be difficult for the caravan’s tortoises to make it through . Fortunately, Officer Zhao had already considered the matter and sent several soldiers to clear a path for them . They forcibly dispersed the crowd to make way .

Even so, the tortoise carriages moved slowly . After travelling for almost two hours, they eventually made their way past ten streets and arrived at a street with rarely few people, stopping in front of a decorated archway that was several stories tall .

Behind the archway were several heavily guarded storehouses with many armed attendants standing nearby .

The following process went exceedingly smooth . The Heavenly East Enterprise handed over their goods to the storehouse officials for inspection . Afterwards, Zhang Kiu received a certificate from them and led the caravan to the west side of the city .

Now having restored his ability to move, Han Li made a sudden proposal to Zhang Kiu when they were halfway to the inn . He wanted to explore the city for a bit before meeting back with them .

When Zhang Kiu heard this, he frowned . Then after some thought, he agreed and said, “Junior Martial Brother Han, you’ve yet to meet the mistress and have yet to officially enter the organization . I won’t restrict you much, but you should take note that many shady characters are now present in An Yuan City . It isn’t very safe, and there can’t be much worth seeing in this small remote city . If you have matters to attend to, I hope you’ll return to the inn quickly when you’re done . ”

Zhang Kiu may have a fierce appearance, but he spoke with tactful words .

Han Li smiled and agreed . Then, he nimbly left them, turning a street corner and disappearing from sight .

Zhang Kiu looked in the direction that Han Li disappeared and stroked his chin, wearing a pensive expression .

“What? Does Benefactor Zhang think that Brother Han won’t return?” Standing at his side, Nan Qizi asked him with a smile .

Zhang Kiu wryly laughed and said, “I’m not worried about that, he already signed the blood curse contract . It’s only that Junior Martial Brother Han seems to be a person with a deep history . He’s rather mysterious . ”

Nan Qizi smiled and added, “He is so young, yet he was able to cultivate such an astonishing body refinement technique . It is impossible that he came from humble origins . And from his bearing, it is obvious he isn’t from the Heavenly Origin Region like us . ”

“Oh, I know that as well . But so long as he doesn’t have a relationship with any of the other great powers in the Heavenly Origin Region, our Heavenly East Enterprise won’t interfere even if he had a problematic history . If we properly nurture this person, it is possible for him to cultivate the fifth layer of the Vajra Arts . In that case, he will certainly turn into Mistress Fang’s strongest soldier . ” Zhang Kiu’s expression turned heavy

Nan Qizi glanced at the scarred man with a mysterious smile, “The fifth layer of the Vajra Arts? If Benefactor Zhang truly thinks that, he will an existence on even grounds with Core Formation cultivators . ”

Zhang Kiu chuckled, “I am holding my hopes rather high . From how young he is and his current cultivation, the possibility of cultivating to the fifth layer of the Vajra Arts still exists . With some luck, he will far exceed common body refiners like me . Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been so eager to have him sign a blood curse contract in the Azure Sifting Desert . ”

“That’s reasonable . Alright, enough of that person . The goods have been delivered . That means that Mistress Fang’s contract with me and my martial brothers have been fulfilled . We will now take our leave . ” Nan Qizi bowed to them and uttered a few words of farewell .

“Oh? You won’t visit the mistress again? In that case, I hope your travels go well!” Failing to keep them any longer, Zhang Kiu bid them a respectful farewell .

The Goulou Mountain cultivators promptly left .

A soldier to the side looked at the departing cultivators and sadly said, “It is truly a pity . If our enterprise was able to have our own cultivators, it would be great . ”

The scarred man sighed, “It is wishful thinking to have our own cultivators . Although our Heavenly East Enterprise is one of the three great merchant unions in the Heavenly Origin Region, we still struggle to acquire spirit stones every year . It isn’t enough to hire cultivators all year round . And Qi Condensation cultivators possess about the same strength as body refiners like us . There isn’t much use in employing them . Foundation Establishment cultivators use an astonishing number of spirit stones year-round as well . It is only when our enterprise has a large order that they are willing to spend spirit stones on them . As for Core Formation cultivators and above, that is something that we can’t even consider . High-grade cultivators require rare materials or magic tools that are far beyond what we can afford . Even if our enterprise manages to somehow foster a mid-grade cultivator, they will eventually leave . ”

“That is so . Even body refiners like us will immediately depart to dangerous areas when they finish their cultivation, in search of rare medicines that can create spirit roots . After all, when one becomes a cultivator, nor only can they cultivate immortal techniques, but their lifespan increases as well . Over the years, it is impossible to know how many funerals we’ve held for body refiners, yet they still journey outside . ” The soldier sadly sighed .

Zhang Kiu then waved his arm, “Enough of that . This has nothing to do with ordinary people like us . Let us return to see the mistress . ”

The soldier immediately shut his mouth .

Thus, the party immediately set off, quickly immersing themselves in the busy streets .

. . .

At that moment, Han Li was standing on a street, looking at the seven blazing suns in the sky and letting out a gloomy sigh .

Ever since he left the Azure Sifting Sands and entered the grasslands, he immediately sensed the astonishing spiritual Qi in the air .

The spiritual Qi in this world was several times greater than what he found in the mortal world . If he was able to find a suitable place of cultivation, it was possible that the spiritual Qi could be over a dozen times greater .

It is a pity that he already dissipated his Nascent Soul . The Ice Phoenix’s restriction is still present on his body, so he wasn’t able to absorb any spiritual Qi, leaving him helpless in this regard .

He then set his sights on the road and looked around him as he walked forward .

The stores on the streets were about the same as he would find in the mortal world, with nothing out of the ordinary .

But suddenly, he stopped and looked at a store in front of him . After some hesitation, he entered and looked around .

There were tables made of sandalwood that shined with the cold light glinting off the weapons they displayed . This was a store that specialized in weapons .

It wasn’t very large, only having two attendants, but there were many customers that visited this store to begin with . Naturally, the two were mortals .

When Han Li entered, he saw that despite the store’s unremarkable exterior, business was treating them quite well and his heart stirred .

When one of the attendants was finished dealing with another guest, he took notice of Han Li and hastily rushed over to him with a smile, “Customer, do you see something you like? Take a look at this gold plated nine ring saber . It was forged from black iron . Not only can it cut through metal, but it is rather heavy . It is an ideal weapon for dealing with wolves . ”

The attendant noticed Han Li was eyeing a large ringed saber . It was pitch-black and appeared remarkably heavy .
