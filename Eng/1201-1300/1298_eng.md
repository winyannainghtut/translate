Chapter 1298: Appearance of the Spirit Clan

Han Li stopped at the outskirts of the valley entrance, sensing a dozen threads of spiritual sense repeatedly brush past him .

Han Li calmly waited for a short while and refused invitations from those that recognized him as a high-grade body refiner .

This valley was only one of several entrances from the human side of the Setting Sun Tomb .

Other entrances were sealed by several strange formations by human cultivators . This was the sole entrance nearby and was naturally guarded by a few cultivators from Setting Sun City to make sure nothing happened .

Of the cultivators secretly guarding the entrance, the weakest of them possessed Core Formation cultivation while the strongest of them was at Deity Transformation stage .

As Han Li began to slowly make his way into the valley, he began to recall the information he gathered about the Setting Sun Tomb over the past few days .

At that moment, he was wearing unremarkable grey battle armor underneath his robes . He also carried a covered long spear on his back .

The spear pole was pitch-black, but it was embedded with several azure crystals that sparkled with light .

The head of the spear was a faint silver, but it was unclear what material it was refined from . As for the earth wyrm tendon, it was wrapped around his arm and remained hidden underneath his robes .

Of course, the trump card Han Li relied on the most were the two Immortal Vanquishing Beads he possessed in his storage bracelet . With those two peak treasures in hand, he could protect himself against even Deity Transformation-stage threats .

The valley was incredibly wide . When Han Li walked for over fifty kilometers, the last of the road disappeared .

Han Li stood in place and looked around him with a sigh .

It was incredibly inconvenient for him to be unable to release his spiritual sense . He couldn't determine his direction and could only venture off in a random direction .

In the first few days, he encountered nothing apart from a few small beasts and serpents .

In an area this large, it wasn’t particularly odd that he didn’t encounter any demon beasts or people .

But five days later, Han Li found himself in front of a dense jungle with no end in sight .

The threes were over a hundred meters tall with dense leaves and branches . It was incredibly dark with beast roars that would occasionally sound in the distance .

Han Li narrowed his eyes for a moment before treading forward . Then after he blurred several times, he appeared behind a large tree .

With the power of Han Li’s current body, the Shifting Smoke Steps he cultivated during his time was a mortal allowed him to move as if he was a bodiless ghost, even in a place with such dense vegetation .

If any others were to see this, they absolutely wouldn’t dare to provoke Han Li in this place .

As Han Li traveled forward, a silver line shot out with a flash and flicked around a nearby giant tree before returning .

A miserable scream then sounded and the stench of blood filled the air . A six-meter-tall yellow horned bear then emerged from behind the tree and changed at Han Li with a roar .

Han Li’s body blurred several times and arrived ten meters away . He continued forward as if he hadn’t noticed the bear .

Then with a crack, the huge bear suddenly burst with blood . It had been split into two in the middle of its charge .

The huge tree the bear was hiding behind soon let out a muffled groan before falling to the ground .

Han Li’s attack split both the huge tree and the bear . Even now, the silver whip refined from the earth wyrm tendon was still as sharp as ever .

As of current, Han Li had already treaded deeper into the jungle .

Thus began Han Li’s path of carnage into the Setting Sun Tomb .

. . .

Three months later, sharp cries and beastly roars sounded from deep within a mountain range . Following the echo of one giant roar, the entire area became silent .

At the source of the sounds stood Han Li with his arms behind his back . He stood on top of a tree that was over thirty meters tall and wore an exceptionally calm expression .

His surroundings were littered by the shredded bodies of azure apes . There were at least twenty corpses .

The apes all appeared burly and had exceptionally dense fur . They also had fangs that were several inches long, giving them a savage appearance .

However, these ape corpses were either dismembered or had bloody holes pierced in their throats and stomachs .

But what was most astonishing was giant red three-headed demon ape at the top of the tree . A black spear pierced through its abdomen and nailed it to the tree .

Blood flowed from every one of its orifices and its body was riddled with scars . It had only recently died .

Han Li examined the huge ape corpse for a long white and muttered, “I haven’t been here before . The rumors of the Setting Sun Tomb are true . To think I would encounter a Core Formation-level demon beast . ” He then held his hand out to the spear .

With azure light glinting from his ring, the black spear trembled and flew into his hand .

The huge ape then dropped down from the tree .

With the spear in hand, Han Li blurred as he headed deeper into the forest .

A moment later, silence returned to the area .

A long while later, azure light flashed from a nearby tree to reveal a ball of green light . Past the light was the form of an inch-large person .

This small person wore a long green robe, a curved body, and a picturesque face . This miniature person was clearly a beautiful woman .

She looked in the direction that Han Li left and frowned .

A yellow light slowly rose from one of the bushes to reveal an old man the same size as the green light . As he held a white crutch in his hand, he turned to the woman and grumbled, “Tian Ying, why did you attack . He was only a high-grade human body refiner . He should be easy for the two of us to take on . ”

The green-robed woman glanced at the old man and indifferent answered, “Huang Shi, we didn’t come here to kill humans and demons . We came here to hunt the rebel and take back their divine blood . We’d best not occupy ourselves with other matters .

The old man shook his head and said, “That person has the power of a Nascent Soul-stage cultivator at most . If we attacked him together, it shouldn’t take much trouble to deal with him . Our spirit clans are great enemies with humans and demons . We should take all measures to weaken human forces when we can . ”

After a moment of silence, the woman explained, “If I was certain we could kill that person, I wouldn’t have hesitated . But there was something odd about him, so I thought it’d be best to avoid provoking anything hidden . ”

“Something odd? Tian Ying, what did you discover?” Huang Shi hastily asked .

The woman’s gaze flickered and she asked, “Do you think that person is truly a body refiner?”

Slight confusion appeared on his face . “What do you mean? That person used spirit tools to kill a Core Formation-level demon beast, but I still wasn’t able to sense any spiritual power from him . What is he if not a body refiner?”

The woman slowly said, “As you should know, I am a tree spirit . I am able to see through things that others cannot . This person’s spiritual sense was immensely powerful, about the same level as ours . According to my knowledge, body refiners can’t possess spiritual sense of that level . It is possible he is a Deity Transformation cultivator . ”

Huang Shi wore an expression of astonishment, “An immensely strong spiritual sense? You mean to say that person isn’t a body refiner, but a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator?”

The woman solemnly said, “I didn’t say that . I can’t sense the existence of spiritual power in his body, but that doesn’t rule out the possibility . After all, human techniques are no less inferior than spirits like us . It isn’t rare for there to truly be such a secret technique . Our objective this journey is to hunt down the rebel and retrieve their divine blood . We don’t want to do anything dangerous and mistakenly arouse trouble . ”

“That is reasonable . If he truly was a Deity Transformation cultivator, we definitely wouldn’t be able to kill him . And even if we were to run away, it would still be considered a loss . In that case, humans are actually quite sly . High-grade demons that come across that human will encounter great misfortune . Who would think that a Deity Transformation cultivator was disguising himself as a body refiner . Even similar-grade existences would suffer from being caught off guard . ” The yellow-robed old man spoke with a trace of schadenfreude .

After a moment of thought, the woman thought of something and asked, “Ah yes, Tie Li and Chi Mie should’ve already entered this place . If something happened to them, our elemental spirit clans should’ve sent more people . Do you think they sent a spirit from the water clan?”

“That is unclear . The water spirit clan is the most mysterious of the five elements, and divine blood is the most important to them . It wouldn’t be odd for them to send someone . ” Huang shi chuckled .

“That is so . However, I heard that the artifact spirit clan is sending men to meddle with this matter . ” The woman said with a hesitant expression .

Anger suddenly welled on Huang Shi’s face . “The artifact spirit clan?” They have the face to send men? The rebel were originally from their clan . ”

“If those words are true, then the tool spirit clan believes that have a greater responsibility to kill the rebel . ” The woman gently replied .

Huang Shi coldly snorted and angrily said, “That is nice to hear, but they’re really just after the divine blood . ”

“Enough . Regardless of what is said, the artifact spirit clan understands humans and demons the most . They will be useful in killing the rebel . I reckon that dared to come here because of some relation they have with the humans . I reckon that the human clan have sent men to receive them . We must retrieve the divine blood before they meet . ” The woman solemnly said .
