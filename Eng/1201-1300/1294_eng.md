Chapter 1294: Taking Back Treasure

The Six-winged Frost Centipede was slightly smaller than the scorpion king, but it was colossal compared to ordinary demon beasts .

When it stretched its ugly head out from the black cloud, it opened its mouth and launched a dense beam of ice .

As the icy light brushed past the air, the sound of tearing space sounded . When the attack struck the huge scorpion, it left a hole three-meters-wide .

The huge scorpion was the result of countless winged scorpions condensed together . Even as powerful as the strike may be, it didn’t truly hurt it . The huge scorpion simply let out a piercing shriek and raised its tail to strike at the frost centipede .

A green light shot out and the scorpion tail seemed to stretch a hundred meters forward as if it were an illusion . It arrived above the centipede’s head and swung down .

Meanwhile, the huge hole in the scorpion abdomen stirred and it quickly mended .

The Six-winged Frost Centipede didn’t appear to mind the attack from the huge tail . The centipede’s wings grew transparent for a moment before the entire centipede disappeared .

The scorpion tale shrieked but it only landed past the air .

In a short moment, the air above the huge scorpion warped to reveal giant winged centipede .

Its wings shook once more and its entire body blurred, charging into the huge scorpion and sinking its fangs deep inside .

A ball of icy light blossomed from the huge scorpion, quickly expanding until it covered most of the scorpion’s body, turning it crystalline .

But then, the light stopped and the huge scorpion’s body crumbled . Countless scorpions rained down from the sky .

The remnants of the giant scorpion no longer condensed back together . Rather, they scattered in every direction .

In the blink of an eye, the rainbow poison cloud completely dissipated .

When the Six-winged Frost Centipede saw this, it didn’t bother to pursue them . It simply opened its mouth and spat out an icy wind . It swept up all the frozen scorpions nearby and brought them to its mouth .

Han Li watched this from a distance, feeling calmer .

He finally realized why the Six-winged Frost Centipede had evolved so quickly . During the time he was away, they devoured countless winged insects . As for those winged scorpions, they seemed to have a history with the centipedes and weren’t ordinary demon insects by any means . They must’ve served as a catalyst after being consumed .

That must’ve been why he hadn’t seen any other insects after he entered the desert . It appeared that they had cleanly devoured by either the scorpions or the centipedes .

Just as Han Li’s thoughts continued, the huge centipede finally finished cleaning off the scorpions and looked down in Han Li’s direction with a cold glint shining from its eye .

When Han Li met its gaze, his heart thumped and he faintly felt the thing he worried the most was about to happen .

Suddenly, the Six-winged Frost Centipede let out a hiss and flapped its wings, arriving in front of Han Li above the blink of an eye .

It coldly looked down at Han Li with a hostile gaze .

Its fangs were clearly gnawing against each other .

Han Li wore an odd expression and stared at the insect without blinking . However, he shook his sleeve behind his back and summoned two Immortal Vanquishing Beads into his palm .

The white centipede simply let out a hiss and turned around, suddenly flying off in the distance and disappearing .

The insect treated Han Li as a mere passerby and went off of its own accord .

Han Li sighed in relief and his stiff face finally loosened . He soon let out a bitter laugh .

The insect’s shocking growth and evolution from four wings to six greatly went against Han Li’s expectations .

Although ancient exotic insects weren’t able to take human form like demon beasts, they were able to develop a level of intelligence .

With such harsh magic power, it naturally thought to sever its spiritual sense connection .

If he still had magic power, he could easily suppress the insect with the restrictions he originally placed on it . But now that he lacked the slightest magic power, all his secret techniques were unusable .

Under these circumstances, it wouldn’t be rare for the centipede to turn on him .

As such, Han Li prepared for the worse and fetched his Immortal Vanquishing Beads with cold sweat lining his palms .

To tell the truth, it was fortunate that Han Li had meticulously nurtured the dozen centipedes since they were larva .

The mental connection between the two had become remarkably stable over the past hundreds of years and now that the dozen centipedes fused together, the connection was a dozen times stronger as well . They were unable to easily shake it off .

Just then, the centipedes struggled to break free for a time before eventually deciding to abandon any hostile intent towards Han Li and go on its own way .

Of course, Han Li made no attempt to stop them .

In his current state, he could only watch them while feeling at a loss of whether he should laugh or cry .

Back in the mortal realm, he spared no effort and even used the small mysterious bottle to nurture the insects . Now that they have matured, he could no longer control them .

He felt somewhat depressed over his loss .

However, Han Li took a breath and soon calmed himself .

Although the insect broke free from his control for the time being, when he recovered his magic power, he could make it yield to him once again .

The only problem was in a place as vast as the spirit realm, he might never see it again, or with so many cultivators present, it could’ve been captured by someone else of considerable power .

Han Li stood in place lost in his thoughts before eventually shaking his head . Eventually, he turned his mind to the Gold Devouring Beetles and the Weeping Soul Beast .

His face sank as he quickened his steps to a place a few hundred meters away .

He took a look down and wordlessly made a fist . With light shining from it, he struck the ground .

A large boom shook the air, scattering the sand as if a top-grade magic treasure struck it .

A large cloud of dust rose into the air, leaving a large crater beneath it . It was over ten meters deep and over thirty-meters wide .

At the heart of the crater were a storage pouch and three spirit beast pouches .

When Han Li saw the storage pouch was intact, he felt relief . Then he walked over to the three spirit beast pouches .

He grabbed them and wore a pensive expression .

Although he wasn’t able to examine them with his spiritual sense, they appeared sealed as he left them . After he weighed it in his hand, he knew nothing was missing from them, apart from the empty pouch that contained the Six-winged Frost Centipedes .

The other two pouches were slightly open . Without looking at them, Han Li could sense the presence of the Gold Devouring Beetles and the Weeping Soul Beast . He could even sense that the Weeping Soul Beast was still soundly asleep .

Han Li’s faintly smiled . The last of his worries were gone .

He promptly put away his pouches deep in his robes .

As they all appeared exquisite, they would contrast with Han Li’s unremarkable appearance .

However, the shed shell the Six-winged Frost Centipede left behind would be somewhat troublesome .

He frowned and simply punched down to make an even larger hole . Then he tossed the shell into the hole and buried it .

Han Li circled around the area several more times and found no other signs, much to his satisfaction .

Then, he looked in the direction that the black cloud disappeared and wore a gloomy expression . Eventually, he gathered himself and walked off .

Now that he completed his first objective, he needed to journey far away to an area filled with demon beasts .

His goal was the border between a demon land and the Heavenly Origin Region .

The border area was a harsh place belonging slightly to both the demon beasts and the Heavenly Origin Region . It was extremely wide and lawless, acting as a buffer between the regions .

Furthermore, demon beasts, savage ancient beasts, and even half-demons on occasion freely roamed the area . The closer one was to the central, the more dangerous it would be .

It was said that mysterious spirit clans made of Deity Transformation individuals or giants that were over a hundred meters tall were seen there . Some even heard the cries of true dragons there as well .

With so many strange rumors, the area was shrouded in a layer of mystery . However, most people didn’t take these rumors to heart .

But, it was true that Deity Transformation-level cultivators and demon cultivators did appear here . This inspired fears in the higher echelons of the demon and human clans . If a fight broke out at that level, it could inspire a war between humans and demons . As a result, such fights were prohibited .

These fights could disturb the origin Qi of heaven and earth, causing rivers to flow backward and mountains to collapse .

Even existences on the level of the three human sovereigns and the seven demon kings opposed such a thing from happening .

If something that dangerous were to happen, the area would truly be too dangerous to tread .

As it so happened, the area was never officially developed or claimed by humans or demons . But the border region contained extremely precious spirit veins and medicines . There were even once of a kind spiritual objects that sovereigns and kings would pay a hefty price for .

As a result, large quantities of cultivators and body refiners would gather there .

They wished to test their luck and acquire a few spirit medicines . Some wished to use the slaughter in the area as a means to break through their cultivation bottlenecks . To tell the truth, this served a similar purpose to beast torrents .

However, low-grade cultivators and body refiners didn’t dare to tread here as it would only mean death . Most of the life in these areas were vastly demons after all .

Under such circumstances, Han Li eventually made his way there after several years of hard travel .
