Chapter 1300: Ice Arrows, Silver Hand

When Han Li looked at the small beast over a hundred meters away, he let out a deep sigh . He panted for a short moment before his breath returned to normal .

However, his eyes didn’t leave the beast for a moment .

The leopard was the same size as a common cat, but it possessed a shocking speed .

Even Han Li’s Shifting Smoke Steps still paled in speed .

As a result, a few swipes managed to land on his azure robes during the battle, revealing the grey armor and golden flesh underneath .

Not only was the beast’s speed astonishing, but its claws were incredibly sharp as well .

There were varying degrees of scars on his armor . Even his cultivated hardy body had blood drawn from the feline’s claws .

Fortunately, under the effects of various medicines, fruits, and treasures, his flesh had become as hardy as an ordinary magic treasure and possessed shocking regenerative abilities . In a short moment, Han Li was able to heal his wounds .

Even so, Han Li still felt quite gloomy .

When he first encountered the leopard, it appeared soundly sleep on top of a nearby tree and appeared harmless .

At that time, Han Li’s mind welled with a child-like curiosity and thought to pet the small beast .

But he hadn’t expected at all that he would startle the beast and send it flying into a ferocious rage .

In a few leaps, it would surround him with a dozen after images attacking him .

As he was unable to release his spiritual sense, he was unable to grasp its location even with his spirit eyes and suffered much from it .

Eventually, the small beast was forced to retreat with minute scars covering its body .

Helpless, Han Li could only use the Smoke Sifting Steps to its maximum level and circulate the enormous power of his body into his arms, flicking his spear until it became a cloud of black light .

As the spear shadow whistled, it inspired fear in the beast, stalling off its attacks .

But no matter how powerful Han Li may be, he couldn't sustain his attack for long .

As the spear in his hand somewhat slowed, the leopard swept through spear mist and swiped at Han Li’s throat .

In Han Li’s furious alarm, he desperately exerted a speed greater than before and quickly turned the spear to block the leopard’s claw .

The small beast was greatly alarmed and jumped ten meters away . Then it cautiously stared at Han Li with a pair of green eyes .

Han Li and the leopard found themselves in a deadlock .

The beast was extremely gloomy to find a strange character such as Han Li who possessed immense strength and impenetrable flesh .

With the formation of the stalemate, Han Li used this opportunity to thoroughly examine the leopard with narrowed eyes .

Soon, Han Li let out a sigh .

Apart from its small size, it appeared to be an ordinary leopard . After searching through his memories of the records he read in Setting Sun City, he wasn’t able to think of what this ferocious ancient beast could be .

It was also impossible for it to be a demon beast .

This small beast was fighting solely with the strength and abilities of its body . It didn’t possess any demonic power .

This should be a beast variant .

After a long while, that was the only conclusion Han Li could think of .

Eventually, the small beast lost its patience and an ominous light flashed in its eye . It crouched in preparation for another attack .

Han Li’s mind trembled and he tightened his grasp on the spear, assuming a defensive stance .

But white light lit up from his other hand as it grasped a spirit beast pouch .

The pouch contained his myriad of Gold Devouring Beetles .

Han Li made the decision that if the beast pounced on top of him, he would open the bag with his spirit ring .

Although he had no magic power and couldn't control the beetles, he could still rely on its ability to dispose of the small beast . The only trouble would be for him to take them back . Without his spiritual sense, he would have to waste them .

However, Han Li was left with no choice .

The small beast let out a snarl and its body blurred, turning to two, then four . . .

In the blink of an eye, over thirty identical small beasts appeared on top of the trees with their fangs bared and ready to pounce .

In Han Li’s alarm, he realized that the beast hadn’t made use of its full strength . He immediately brought the back in front of him and was about to toss it .

But then in that crucial moment, a strange bird’s cry sounded from a distance . It sounded like a crow, but it was far harsher .

When the leopard heard this, its face froze and its afterimages disappeared . In the blink of an eye, only one of them remained .

The feline took a deep glance at Han Li before turning its head and shooting deep into the forest .

A short moment later, it disappeared from sight .

Han Li relaxed and retrieved his spirit beast pouch .

Although he didn’t know what was going on, he had no interest in pursuing the cat . He needed to find someplace where he could comprehend what just happened .

In the last battle, there were exceptional developments and he came to a faint realization of something . This was a possibility for him to make a breakthrough .

With a flip of his hand, he took out an azure robe from his storage bracelet and replaced the torn clothes on his body . Then, he head off in a direction away from the leopard .

Because Han Li feared that this feeling of revelation would soon disappear, Han Li didn’t walk far away . Rather, he quickly ran fifty kilometers away to a small valley and struck open a rough cave in a stone wall .

He immediately entered it and sat down cross-legged .

Comprehending his recent flash of enlightenment took him three entire days .

When Han Li opened his eyes once more, he wore a disappointed face .

Although he made some gains from that battle, it wasn’t enough for him to break past his current bottleneck .

But he wasn’t too saddened .

Although he didn’t succeed this time, this illustrated life and death battles would be of great assistance in making a breakthrough . If he experienced several more desperate battles, he was bound to succeed .

After calming his heart, he arranged his belongings and left the cave .

Standing outside the cave, he paused in thought for a long while . He felt that the small beast was the ideal opponent for him . If he could fight it several more times, he may succeed in obtaining an epiphany .

Although he knew it would be dangerous, the restoration of his magic power was far more important .

His expression wavered for a long while before resolving himself to seek out that dangerous leopard .

When he left the valley, Han Li headed in the direction where the leopard is last seen, but he ended up greatly disappointed .

In a single breath, he swept through hundreds of kilometers in the surrounding mountain range, but he found no trace of the beast .

Helpless, Han Li could only depart from the mountains and find another suitable objective .

Over ten days later at the edge of a huge lake, there were a dozen variously dressed body refiners . They were surrounded by crimson snakes with a crest on their heads . The body refiners were using their spirit tools to their utmost extent while attacking the serpents .

The serpent’s attacks were separated into two types . There were those shooting a crimson venom mist, while the others were pouncing at the body refiners like darts .

The venom was tolerable enough as they had swallowed an antivenom beforehand, but they weren’t able to block the serpents’ direct attacks .

The serpents weren’t very large, but their bodies possessed considerable power . Despite the powerful spirit tools the body refiners wielded, they weren’t able to injure the serpents when they struck them .

As a result, the body refiners defended against the serpents many times before they felt their limbs grow heavy and slow .

In addition to these few serpents, there was also a giant serpent behind them .

The serpent appeared to be the group’s king . When it saw that its party had the advantage, it let out several hisses as if it were expressing satisfaction .

But suddenly, booms of lightning sounded from below the lake . Before the humans or the serpents could react, a large silver light flashed from below and countless arrows of light burst forth, felting the humans and serpents on the shore without discrimination .

“AH!” The body refiners could only cream, but they weren’t able to dodge, and the serpents were no better . The lot of them were turned into pincushions by the ice spikes .

Only the huge serpent at the back was quick enough to react . It suddenly bent its body and pounced thirty meters away, narrowly dodging the ice arrows .

But before the serpent landed, the earth beneath it burst . A silver hand shot out from the soil and grabbed the serpent by the neck .

In the serpent’s alarm, it turned like a spring and wound its head around to bite down on the hand .

But a clear ring sounded after the strike . The hand was unharmed and the serpent was in pain, blood trailing from its mouth .

The huge serpent’s teeth were completely shattered by the silver hand’s exceptional hardiness .

In pain, the serpent could only relax its mouth let go .

Another silver hand then strangely appeared nearby . It grabbed ahold of the serpents head and both hands exerted their stretch, pulling them apart . Left headless, the serpent’s body spouted in a fountain of blood .

The serpent corpse was then tossed to the ground .

At that moment, the dust eventually cleared and a silver man appeared, hidden by flickering sliver lights around his body .

At that moment, the ice from the lake moved, suddenly merging into a crystalline person a foot tall . It didn’t have any features of a man or a woman .

“Water Wraith! It’s you!” When the silver silhouette saw the ice woman, he suddenly spoke with a thunderous voice .

The ice person stirred and expressionlessly said, “What? Tie Ren, didn’t you come here to find me? Chi Mie should’ve come too . Call him out . ”

“Hehe, there is no need to call for me . I’ll show myself . . ”

An unfamiliar voice suddenly sounded and a ball of scarlet flame appeared near the silver silhouette . In the blink of an eye, he took the form of a man half a foot tall .

Flames still roiled from his entire body .
