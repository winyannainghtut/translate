Chapter 1272: Demon Serpent

Under the spell formation’s effects, the situation reversed . It appeared they could hold out for a while longer .

But just as Han Li was wordlessly watching the battle, something unexpected occurred .

Following a loud bang, an explosion occurred near the three women . A demon beast with a serpent’s body and a human head shot out from the sand .

The demon serpent had a head of sickly yellow hair and a hideous woman’s face . A pair of delicate infant-white arms emerged from its side, each holding a meter-long bone spear . Black Qi wrapped around the spears, revealing themselves to be low-grade magic tools .

As soon as the demon serpent appeared, the three women controlling the formation turned pale with fright . The demon serpent turned to look at the women in charge of the formation and flashed a malevolent smile and wordlessly waved her spears . Three black lights streaked from the spear and flew towards the women .

The three were quick to react . They immediately recovered from their shock and took out the flags from the formation, hastily waving it in front of them .

Several crackles sounded as a wave of mist suddenly appeared in front of them .

The black lights flew into the mist, resulting in three large explosions . The mist scattered from the strike but managed to block the attack for Xiang’er and the white-robed woman . However, the red-robed woman’s mist was far weaker . When the black light struck the mist, her body trembled and she flew out into the air, away from the mist’s protection .

The red-robed woman knew things were far from good and she turned deathly pale . For a time, she wasn’t able to control her own body .

When the demon serpent saw this, it smashed down its tail and its body blurred, arriving below her with its spear held out .

The other two women yelled out but they weren’t able to protect her .

In the following moment, the woman was about to be stabbed by the glowing black bone spear .

But at that moment, a piercing sound whistled through the air . A white object struck the spear with strange accuracy .

Bang . The spear was pushed a half-foot away, brushing past the woman’s clothes . The woman was left deathly pale with her brush from death, but she used the opportunity to regain control of her body . With a flip, she nimbly landed on the ground .

The white object was an unremarkable stone .

The demon serpent was surprised, but malevolent glint flashed from its eye and with its other arm, it released a chain of stabs .

However, yet another whistling sound shrieked through the air . This time, a stone didn’t strike the spear but pounded towards the demon serpent’s head .

The stone clearly carried an immense strength . If the attack truly struck the serpent, it might not shatter its skull, but it would be enough to leave it dazed at the very least .

The demon serpent was enraged and had no choice but to turn its head to the side and use its spear and block the oncoming stone .

But with a muffled thump, the serpent felt a huge force knock against its hand, forcing it back several steps . Enraged, it turned to look in the direction where the stone came from .

A young man was looking down at it from the top of a nearby tortoise carriage . He was fiddling with a similar stone in his hand .

It was Han Li .

The red-robed woman had now arrived next to her companions in a blur and let out a sigh of relief .

Having been foiled twice, the serpent felt immense rage and opened its mouth to release a black poisonous mist towards the three women .

But then, Nan Qizi’s voice sounded from one of the carriages, “Evil creature! You dare?!”

Soon after, the white light shot out from the carriage window . It circled once in the air before cleaving at the demon . It was a crystalline sword that was several inches large .

When the serpent saw this, its expression changed and it ceased spitting its poison . It rushed to toss the spear in its hand with all its strength at the carriage it came from . It then twisted its body to duck into the sand .

When it saw more cultivators appear, it didn’t dare to fight and immediately flee .

As for the spear, it was aimed at Han Li .

Obviously, the demon thought to take revenge on the mortal that thought to ruin its fun and express its resentment .

When Han Li saw the black light coming towards him, he wryly smiled . Not only did he not use the stone in his hand, but he also stood still in place .

Boom . The spear struck Han Li accurately, and he was sent flying over thirty meters away, leaving a large hole in a carriage’s container he fell on . The crash resulted in twinkling blades falling out from a carriage’s storage .

“Ah!”

When the three women saw this, they let out a cry of alarm . As for Nan Qizi, he let out a yelp from a neighboring carriage .

Afterwards, Nan Qizi’s small sword circled in the air before turning to him .

At that moment, the red-robed woman shook her flag and scattered her protective mist, then running over to the container .

“Brother Han, are . . . are you alright!?” She worryingly cried out .

A trace of worry also appeared on the other two women’s faces .

“I am well . However, my body can’t seem to move . ” Han Li spoke out with a wry chuckle .

The three women were relieved to hear this and exchanged a glance . They all jumped on top of the giant tortoise in question and looked at the damaged container .

They saw Han Li lying down on a pile of spears and sabers with town robes . He appeared helpless, but there were no obvious injuries .

The three were overjoyed and dragged him out in a joint effort .

“Brother Han, thank you for saving my life!” The red-robed woman gratefully said .

Han Li chuckled and casually answered, “It wasn’t much . It only took a slight effort . However, the attack has left me helpless . I’ll have to lay down for a moment longer . ”

A trace of surprise appeared on his face and Nan Qizi smiled, saying, “There is nothing wrong . The Vajra Arts is worthy of being of the five great body refining techniques . You are already so strong after cultivating the third layer . That evil creature’s magic tool wasn’t what harmed Benefactor Han, but the exertion of the rock throwing has caused some injury to your meridians . It should be healed with some rest . ”

“I am glad!” The red-robed woman said with joy .

Nan Qizi smiled and looked at the formation diagram that no longer glowed with light . He chuckled and said with a deeper tone, “How could this humble Daoist lie? However, the situation will turn for the worse now that you’ve stopped driving the Minor Returning Spring Formation . ”

When that was said, the three’s expression vastly changed and they hastily looked around them . They saw that the guards have become exhausted once more without the aid of the formation, and they have resumed taking casualties .

“Damn . We’ve only brought one copy of the formation diagram . We’ve used all the power from our formation flags to block the demon serpent . We won’t be able to activate it again . ” The white-robed woman cried out .

The other two looked at each other in dismay .

“That is truly troublesome!” The Daoist priest frowned . As they thought of a plan, they suddenly heard the sounds of battle around them stop . Suddenly, the guards let out a resounding cheer .

The women looked around in surprise . They saw that the huge worms were jumping off the carriages and fleeing in a panic . They seemed to have lost all their previous mettle .

“It is done! Sister Liu’er and the others must’ve defeated the insect demons . ” The green-robed woman said with a grin . The other two also wore pleasant expressions .

As expected, several tens of cavalry were returning to the caravan, leaving dust clouds in their wake .

Out of the fifty-some cavalry that went out on the attack, only about thirty managed to return . Furthermore, many of them were injured and stained with blood . It was clear they had a desperate battle .

When the wolf-mounted cavalry returned, the large scarred man tossed something on the ground . It was the head of a huge worm, but its body was entirely golden .

The blue-robed woman leading the crimson tiger appeared entirely without injury .

When the two saw Nan Qizi and the three women surrounding Han Li, they revealed a trace of shock .

At that moment, one of the guards gave a detailed explanation of what happened .

The scarred man soon let out a bellow, it appears that I’ve made the right decision to take you into our organization . As soon as you joined, you already saved Quan’er . If something truly happened, I wouldn’t have the face to see the mistress . ”

When the blue-robed woman heard this, she looked at Han Li with a friendly face .

Han Li simply smiled back and said nothing else .

Since they repelled the Sandbug Beasts, the troops needed to rest . After half a day, they resumed their journey .

The rest of the way was remarkably peaceful . After three days, the caravan left the Azure Sifting Desert and was met with an endless grassland . It was incredibly flat .

With this, the speed of the caravan increased several times as the tortoises could walk with bigger steps .

As for Han Li, he remained still on his back, unable to move . He later noticed that the banter from the caravan instantly went silent after they entered the grassland .

In addition, the four women sitting the carriage looked at the grassland with an uneasy expression, faintly betraying a sense of dread .
