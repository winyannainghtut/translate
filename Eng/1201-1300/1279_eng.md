Chapter 1279: Azure Wolf, Crimson Python, Leocon Beast

The embroidered-robed man shook his head, “I’ve already seen Captain Zhang and the mistress’ Liu Brothers . If Brother Han wasn’t here, we would use either of them, but now that we have a more suitable candidate, we will have to make the more reliable choice . After all, he completed the third layer of the Vajra Arts; he has nothing to fear from the attack of low-grade spirit tools, and his immense strength will make him even more suitable for the journey . If we were to take someone else, the odds of defeat will be greater . If we startle those demon beast guards, we won’t get a second chance . Mistress, could it be you don’t wish for Junior Martial Brother Pan to achieve Core Formation?”

Mistress Fang sighed and she said with a tone of helplessness . “Senior Martial Brother Qin’s words are reasonable . Even if this person has as much potential as ‘Old Fire’, I feel like Qin’er’s Core Formation will possess far more potential . ”

The embroidered-robed man felt relief and he smiled, “Lady Fu is quite a sensible person! The breakout of this beast torrent turned into an exceptional opportunity . It appears those demon beast guards aren’t involving themselves . When the time comes, we might be able to escape from them . That’s why although we need a body refiner, he won’t necessarily be needed . So long as the matter succeeds, I won’t treat him unfairly and make sure he doesn't harbor a grudge against you . ”

“Immortal Qin’s magic power is quite strong . After you acquire it, there should be no problem in Core Formation . In the future, I hope you’ll look after my son . ” When that was said, she smiled and didn’t directly address him .

The man glanced at the blue-robed youth and warmly said, “Hehe, Junior Martial Brother Pan’s aptitude is no less than mine . If I can achieve Core Formation, Junior Martial Brother should have no problem with the item in hand . The mistress should feel at ease . ”

Pan Qing saluted his Senior Martial Brother with a deep expression and uttered words of thanks .

As for the pair sitting next to the embroidered robed man, they glanced at one another with a knowing smile .

During this time, the atmosphere in the hall became rather friendly .

Han Li couldn't have known that his first contact with humans in the spirit realm already involved him in a scheme .

It was unknown if he was cursed by the heavens or just had bad luck . In case he knew about this matter, he would’ve simply found himself not knowing whether to laugh or cry .

A few trifling mortals and Foundation Establishment cultivators thought of using him, a Deity Transformation cultivator . They were beyond reckless . Even without his magic power, he had methods of easily killing them .

But as he was kept in the dark and intended on remaining with the Heavenly East Enterprise, he left the courtyard and went to see the large scarred man .

Not long after, Han Li was appointed a hi second in command but there were others that weren’t convinced .

But when Han Li revealed a portion of his immense strength, he alarmed them and kept them quiet .

Because Han Li was given his own room, he didn’t have to mingle with the others .

In the following days, he began to grasp the chant for the fifth layer of the Vajra Arts .

According to the Brightjade Arts, It would be much smoother if he could cultivate using the magic power present in his body . But now, he would have to cultivate the Vajra Arts by infusing spiritual Qi into his body .

He had no choice but to familiarize himself with this strange method before starting his cultivation .

Three days later, Han Li left the inn and disappeared half a day .

Apart from those with a discerning eye, most people hadn’t noticed that Han Li was gone .

But on the seventh day, Han Li was sitting cross-legged on his bed when he suddenly heard huge bell clangs from outside the room . The sound loudly droned and faintly shook the inn .

Han Li opened his eyes in shock .

The rumbling clangs repeated without end and was soon followed by resounding horns, crying out to the city one after another .

Han Li frowned and wordlessly walked out .

The west courtyard was already scrambling into action . The guards and cavalrymen were walking out from their rooms with weapons and armor in hand . Their expressions ranged anywhere from excitement to fear and worry .

As panicked voices sounded through the courtyard, Zhang Kui walked through with an icy expression and loudly rebuked, “What is there to panic about? It is only a beast torrent . It hasn’t reached us yet . Return to your rooms and properly rest yourselves . When the time comes, rest will only be a delusionary thought . ”

When the soldiers heard the large man, they all calmed down and obediently returned to their rooms .

Han Li saw this with a smile .

As Zhang Kui held his position as the guard commander for over ten years, his reputation was as high as one would expect .

Zhang Kui glanced over at Han Li and said, “Junior Brother Han, follow me to observe and size and scope of the beast torrent . Let’s see how it compares to what we expected . ”

Han Li quickly replied, “Brother Zhang, I am ready to follow . ”

In truth, although he didn’t take this beast torrent to heart, he was indeed a bit curious .

He wasn’t about to refuse an opportunity to broaden his horizons .

When the two walked onto the street outside the inn, he discovered there was something amiss . The bustling streets no sparsely had anyone . There were only a few wanderers and their movements were all flustered .

There were several beast carriages on the street, but they were in a mad rush . There were also horned wolves, the same that the Heavenly East Enterprise cavalrymen rode . However, the ones who rode them this time were wearing the armor of city guards . They were rushing through the city, loudly declaring martial law on the city as a result of the upcoming beast torrent .

They were not only drafting body refiners and soldiers, but common mortals were to stay put in their residences . If they were outside and hindered the efforts of resisting the beast torrent, they would be immediately executed .

When Han Li and Zhang Kui rode two horned wolves to the nearest wall, there was a large purple-robed man standing at the top of the southmost tower in the city . He looked outside the window with one hand pressed against it and the hand held behind his back . He silently looked in the distance with a sullen expression .

Suddenly, the door to his room opened and a soldier covered in azure bone armor quickly entered . He kneeled behind the azure-robed man and softly reported, “City Lord, we’ve verified that the beasts gathered in three waves: the Jade Grassland’s Azure wolves, the Black Tomb Mountain’s Crimson Pythons, and the Leocon Beasts . ”

The large purple-robed man sighed and he worriedly said, “So it is an attack by three beast types . Very troublesome . If they were other beasts, it would’ve been fine, but azure wolves and crimson pythons only join beast torrents every three hundred years . Not to mention these astonishing numbers, the Leocon Beasts will make things more troublesome as well .

They will attack the weakest point of our city . Although we already prepared bows and crossbows, they fly too quickly so common arrows won’t be effective . ”

“Didn’t you place an order from the Heavenly East Enterprise for exploding crystal arrows, Sir? We should be able to hold our own against them . Besides, we have cultivators assisting us . They will be a powerful force to defend the skies . With their assistance, the hawks shouldn’t be a problem . ” The armored soldier consoled .

The purple-robed man commanded, “We can only hope to rely on them . Arrange the cultivators together and have them keep watch on the hawk’s actions . We will have the soldiers and body refiners join forces in dealing with the wolves and pythons . Ah yes, quickly bring our forces to the ready . Have our guards take turns standing guard . ”

“Yes, Sir!” An armored soldier yelled and went off to execute his order .

The large purple-robed man was the An Yuan City Lord . He looked out his window with a heavy expression .

. . .

Han Li stood on top of a segment of the city wall and looked at the distance . Although he appeared calm, his heart was shaken .

He saw yellow earth tens of kilometers from the city turn azure . An azure sea spanned as far as he could see . Upon closer inspection, he could make out the silhouette of wolves within them . Their eyes were green and their bodies were azure . Their bared fangs created a savage appearance .

The number of wolves were too many to count . They could no longer determine how many hundreds of thousands there were .

Apart from the wolf howls, there were the sounds of other beasts mixed in . They sounded in some sort of pattern as if they were communicating with one another .

Zhang Kui’s face turned somewhat pale, but he gripped his hands in a fist and muttered, “Fortunately, the most common beast are the azure wolves . If we encountered red, yellow, or even the rare silver wolf, I fear that An Yuan City wouldn’t be able to survive the beast torrent . ”

“Silver wolves?” When Han Li heard this, something suddenly came to mind .

In his surprise, the scarred man explained, “What? Has Brother Han never seen silver wolves before? They are several times harder to handle than other wolves . A common silver wolf is a match for a dozen azure wolves . In the last beast torrent, I was lucky enough to see several of them . Their fearsomeness is fresh in my memory . ”
