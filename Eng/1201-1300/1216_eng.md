The jet-black octagonal hammer simply emitted a thread of sparkling blue flame in response to being caught by the cauldron . The chilliness the flame emitted was downright eerie .

Although Han Li couldn't tell just how powerful the devil flames were, they were by no means ordinary .

Blue flame wrapped around the Heavenvoid Cauldron and rigidly trapped it in the air without the slightest show of effort . No matter how fiercely the cauldron flames burned, the blue thread was completely unaffected .

Han Li ignored what was happening above him and turned his sights on the four black streaks that were shooting towards him .

“The Devil Sages?” Han Li muttered silently . A trace of a smile appeared on his face and he shook his sleeve .

Suddenly, several rolls of thunder sounded out, followed by four dense bolts of lightning arcing out from his sleeve . In a flash, they accurately struck the four black streaks .

Several explosions sounded out as four blinding golden flashes ruptured, drowning out the black streaks in an instant . The devil phantoms seemed to have met their weakness and quickly evaporated like morning dew .

This had taken Han Li only a token effort .

In the mere blink of an eye, the azure silhouette behind Han Li raised its hand and produced a small crimson bow in its hand, drawing it back .

A deafening boom shook the air . Blinding red light and countless arrows of flame were released, filling the sky with its barrage .

At that moment, the spike-covered devil saw a skyful of arrows shooting towards it and looked on with fear . It let out a large shout and its body glowed with crimson light .

When the spiked devil finished taking its defensive actions, the barrage struck its barriers .

Countless arrows ruptured on impact and the devil was submerged in flames . Explosions shook the air for a long while, in a display of their terrifying power .

However, the devil within the flames remained unscathed inside its crimson barriers . It took a deep breath and it waved their silver arms, intending on cutting away the crimson flames that surrounded it .

Then, the sounds of thunder struck .

In the devil’s fright, it discovered that a green arrow was shooting towards them in an arc of lightning .

Although the devil didn’t know the arrow was precisely, it blurred from sight in an attempt to dodge it .

But what the devil failed to sense while they were distracted by the arrow was the black crystal knife that strangely appeared above them . As silently as it appeared, it dropped down and slid itself toward its head .

The spiked devil hadn’t noticed a thing .

Suddenly, the azure silhouette halted their attack and the endless barrage of flame arrows came to a halt .

Baffled by this change and still evading the green arrows, a black streak silently circled one of the devil’s necks like a bolt of lightning and its triangular head toppled of its neck .

The crimson light barrier may as well have been air .

This came as no surprise . The knife was refined from a Devil Essence Diamond, an extremely rare material condensed for countless years from pure devilish Qi . How could a barrier quickly formed from devil Qi hope to block it?

With Han Li’s second Nascent Soul residing in the human-like puppet, it didn’t require any instruction . In the instant, the dagger executed the devil, it rushed forward to the devil’s corpse .

It opened its mouth and a cloud of black light rushed out from it, enveloping the corpse .

Then, it dragged out a phantom from the body that had a striking resemblance to the devil . The phantom was so dim that it looked like it could disperse at any moment .

It was then dragged back into the puppet’s mouth in the cloud and absorbed by the second Nascent Soul residing inside of it .

The pure devilish Qi would prove to be significant to the cultivation of the Zenith Yin Arts .

With the phantom absorbed, the headless devil corpse dissolved into ash with a gentle wind .

Then in a blur, the puppet returned to Han Li’s side with its arms behind its back .

From a distance, if it weren’t for the difference of their clothes, it would appear as if there were two of Han Li standing side by side .

At the moment, Han Li was fiddling with his Triflame Fan as he calmly looked across from him .

Han Li indifferently said, “Fellow Daoist Six Paths, I’ve already seen your Six Apex Devils technique . If you don’t have any else to impress me with, I will be sending you off . ”

When Archsaint Six Paths heard this, his face grew pale and disbelief was betrayed from his eyes .

Two of the late Nascent Soul-stage demons he regarded as his trump cards were exterminated with ease . It was beyond belief .

Furthermore, his opponent was able to make use of the flame fan, the small azure cauldron, and the green wooden ruler; each of these treasures possessed an immense power . Let alone the famous Heavenvoid Cauldron and Han Li’s use of the incarnation techniques, he didn’t have the slightest information on the other two grand treasures . But what was particularly bizarre was that his unfathomable incarnation alone was able to slay one of his devils .

His heart dropped .

How was this possible? Han Li should’ve only been at late-Nascent Soul stage for about a hundred years at most . For him to master these profound techniques and acquire these grand treasures in such a short amount of time .

Although he had never seen a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator, he had no doubt that Han Li’s current abilities were close to one .

When the old devil heard Han Li’s words, his back trembled and his eyes narrowed . Then he opened his mouth and a scarf of black mist roiled out .

The object quickly blurred and immediately covered him in black wind .

The winds let out a shrieking whistle before letting out a tremble and kiting backwards, carrying the old devil with them .

The black wind became vague and flew at immense speed . Several blurs later, it left a chain of afterimages .

In an instant, the wind strangely appeared an even greater distance away . There even was a remnant of black wind in its original position .

As a result, there were several balls of black wind present, all capable of teleporting away . In the blink of an eye, they could travel over three hundred meters away . A normal late-Nascent Soul cultivator would feel helpless against such bizarre movements .

Of course, Han Li wasn’t an ordinary late-Nascent Soul cultivator by any means . When he saw this, he wore an odd expression, “So you’re actually running away . Your bonded magic treasure seems quite good at it . If it were before, I fear I may have had some trouble . But now, ha . . . ”

Han Li took a deep sigh and the Thunderstorm Wings trembled behind his back, letting out a roll of thunder . Arcs of white and azure lightning appeared on the wing’s surface . Soon after, they formed balls of lightning in the surrounding air, spinning in place .

As he stretched out his wings, he floated in the air, drifting slightly to the side .

At the moment, he was looking in the distance at the black blur that was Archsaint Six Paths . He snorted and fanned his wings once .

Gales immediately erupted around him and the suspended balls of lightning raged, striking together .

Azure-white lightning erupted in deafening booms, only for the gales to gather all of it into the two wings .

Covered in a layer of lightning, the Thunderstorm Wings wildly flapped several times, followed by Han Li disappearing from his original location in a flash of azure-white lightning .

A breath later, lightning sparked a hundred meters away, and it happened again after a pause, each time, heading a hundred meters further out . Its speed was quite faster than the old devil’s black winds .

In several blinks, the lightning pursued the black wind until it was only thirty meters away .

As Han Li rode the lightning, he could clearly see the old devil’s face of terror within the black wind .

With another wave of his wings, another clap of thunder roared, and he arrived in front of the black wind in an azure-white flash .

The lightning faded to reveal Han Li blocking the old devil’s path .

The black gales came to a brief stop, only to quickly change direction .

At that moment, Han Li sneered and held his hands in an incantation gesture and lightning clapped from within him . His stature burst several inches in size, grew thicker, with four arms jutting out from his flesh . Golden light lit up on his skin only for a moment before disappearing .

In the blink of an eye, he turned into a large man of immense strength and stature . This was the transformation after making use of the third layer of the Brightjade Arts .

With this transformation done, he raised his hands, summoning purple flames in his hands, and he held them together to form a large purple saber of flame .

Afterward, the wings on his back strangely trembled and he shot forward .

But his body strangely warped the moment he set off and his wings trembled with inconceivable frequency, causing the nearby air to warp with its movements . He disappeared in a white line along the way .

When the old devil saw this, he knew things were turning out for the worst . Seeing that he could no longer flee, he concentrated the magic power in his body and caused the black wind surrounding him to surge in size . At the same time, he flipped his hand, producing a crimson shield in front of him .

Just as he was about to activate it, a white line appeared above him and vanished as soon as it had appeared .

Following that was the old devil’s loud yell .

The crimson shield now fell to the ground along with the part of his arm, the rest of his arm covered in purple ice .

The stump of an arm was smooth and sleek, leaving not a drop of blood behind .
