Chapter 1191: Tribulation Transcendence

Half a month later, the stone door of the secret chamber opened by itself, and Han Li emerged from within with a tranquil expression .

Silver light flashed outside the door, and the humanoid puppet, which was now completely identical to Han Li, appeared before him .

Han Li glanced at the puppet, and a smile appeared on his face . He stroked his own forehead, upon which the second Nascent Soul immediately appeared .

The Nascent Soul wore a completely blank expression as its body swayed before flying through the air as a streak of black light, disappearing into the humanoid puppet's body .

Moments later, the puppet suddenly blinked its dead eyes, and it was suddenly filled with vitality, as if it were an actual living person .

Han Li rubbed his hands together with a smile upon seeing this . "Not bad . This is exactly how I envisioned this go . Using the secret technique on the Great Development Treasure Scriptures to inject the second Nascent Soul into the humanoid puppet's body allows it to control the puppet . From now on, I won't have to worry about being unable to control the puppet due to distance constraints . As long as I don't go on excessively lengthy journeys in the future, the humanoid puppet can remain in this cave abode along with the second Nascent Soul . "

"This is indeed a very creative masterstroke, Fellow Daoist Han, but aren't you worried that mishaps could occur if the second Nascent Soul develops sentient will again? In that case, it would possess a late-Nascent Soul Stage vessel in the form of this humanoid puppet . It'll be extremely difficult for you to recover the second Nascent Soul again after that," the unimpressed voice of a small child suddenly sounded from within Han Li's sleeve .

"I'm well aware of that potential risk, Fellow Daoist, which is why on this occasion, I'll be using a few restriction secret techniques that I recently mastered as a late-Nascent Soul cultivator on the second Nascent Soul, and I'll also be tinkering with the humanoid puppet a bit as well . Unless the second Nascent Soul's spiritual sense really becomes more powerful than that of my main Nascent Soul, I'll be able to completely immobilize at any time I want," Han Li replied confidently .

"Hehe, looks like you've planned things out well in advance, Fellow Daoist Han . It appears that my concerns were unwarranted," the small child chuckled .

"Regardless, I must still thank you for your kind intentions . Now then, would you like to transcend your lightning tribulation here on the interconnected peaks or go somewhere else during this process?" Han Li asked .

The small child hesitated momentarily before suggesting in a euphemistic manner, "These interconnected peaks most likely won't be a good place for tribulation transcendence . After all, even the restriction here won't be able to conceal the metamorphosis stage lightning tribulation . I have full trust in your abilities, but I think it's best to find a more secluded place . "

"Alright, I'll go and see Wan'er first, then take you somewhere else . " Han Li had no intention of arguing with the Endless Sky Beast on this manner .

He then exited the cave abode and traveled to the Drifting Cloud Sect to visit Nangong Wan in order to check on her cultivation progress .

A day later, Han Li left the Drifting Cloud Sect again, and flew toward the west as a streak of azure light .

Five days later, Han Li appeared above an extremely barren and desolate set of plains .

There was not a single blade of grass growing on this land, and there were only yellow soil as well as greyish-white rocks of different sizes stretching as far as the eye could see in all directions .

Han Li unleashed his spiritual sense to survey the area in a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers, upon which he discovered that there wasn't so much as a single cultivator or mortal around .

Han Li swept a sleeve through the air, and a small cauldron enshrouded in a ball of azure light shot forth from within . He then said, "How about this place? This is a vast expanse of dead land on the border between our State of Xi and the State of Huayu . There's no one around for hundreds of thousands of kilometers, so it'll be a lot safer for you to transcend your metamorphosis stage lightning tribulation here . "

The small child inside the cauldron gave an elated reply, "This is indeed a good place for tribulation transcendence! Please release my true body from the cauldron and let me meditate for three days . After that, I'll be ready for the tribulation transcendence . "

"No problem!" Han Li nodded before flicking a finger toward the small cauldron in the air .

A light thud rang out as the cauldron lid flew into the air of its own accord . The small cauldron then tipped itself over, and a burst of azure light swept forth, revealing a demon beast that was about half a foot in size with the head of a cow and the body of a wyrm .

Upon emerging from the azure light, the demon beast's body instantly swelled drastically to several tens of feet in size, and its entire body was shimmering with azure light .

"I'll have to trouble you to protect me for a while here, Fellow Daoist," the demon beast said in the voice of a small child . Its wyrm body then coiled up, and it descended onto a large white rock down below, where it sat in a completely stationary manner .

Han Li didn't say anything as he looked on from above . However, his body then swayed, and he also descended onto a nearby rock, where he sat with his eyes closed and his legs crossed .

Thus, the two of them sat for three days and three nights .

Just as the sun began to rise on the fourth day, both of them opened their eyes in unison .

"The magic power within my body is now in its most optimal state, so I have at least a 60%to 70% chance of being able to successfully transcend this lightning tribulation . You don't have to help me in the initial phase; if I encounter any difficulty, it should be in the later phases . If you can defend me from the final three waves of lightning strikes, I'd be extremely grateful to you," the Endless Sky Beast said with a serious expression .

"I see . I'll do as you say . I suggest you take a drop of this before you transcend your tribulation . " Han Li suddenly flipped his hand over to summon a small profound ice vial that was emanating bursts of glacial Qi, and he tossed the vial to the demon beast before him .

"What's this?" The demon beast caught the vial with a slightly bewildered expression, then opened the lid on the vial and assessed its contents with its spiritual sense .

"Glacial Quintessence? I didn't think you would have something like this, Fellow Daoist," the Endless Sky Beast exclaimed with shock and elation .

"I happened to obtain some during my time in the Great Jin . Seeing as you taught me the beveled silver text, I can offer a drop of this Glacial Quintessence to you . I hope that's enough for you," Han Li said as he stroked his chin .

"Haha, it's definitely enough! Glacial Quintessence is something that's extremely rare, even in the Spirit Realm . Some would occasionally be discovered, but they would quickly be taken by my demon race brethren . " The Endless Sky Beast was very excited as he turned to Han Li, and said, "Just a single drop of this is enough for me . I'll remember this and be sure to repay you handsomely for this in the future . "

The demon beast's final sentence was very earnest .

Han Li smiled upon hearing this, but didn't reply . Instead, he patted the storage pouch hanging from his waist, and a stack of formation flags and formation plates abruptly appeared in his hand .

He then began setting up a relatively complex restriction formation in the surrounding area .

Around 10 minutes, Han Li's body swayed, and he returned to his original spot . Layers of white mist had appeared nearby, concealing the entire area .

Han Li turned to the demon beast, and said, "This formation should be able to prevent any unforeseen mishaps from taking place . I'll be assisting you from outside the formation, and I'll leave the initial waves of lightning tribulation to you, Fellow Daoist . "

"Of course . Metamorphosis stage tribulation lightning is true heavenly lightning, so there's no way that a normal restriction in the human world would be able to keep it at bay . By the way, my lightning tribulation can perhaps benefit you as well . " A thought seemed to have suddenly occurred to the demon beast, and a peculiar light flashed through its eyes .

"Your lightning tribulation can benefit me?" Han Li was quite surprised to hear this .

"Indeed . This is a little-known fact in the human world, but something that is common knowledge in the Spirit Realm . " The Endless Sky Beast chuckled before its lips tremored, and it began to transmit its voice to Han Li .

Han Li listened within a hint of bewilderment on his face, which was gradually replaced by excitement .

"If that really is true, then this is indeed a rare opportunity . I just so happen to be carrying a treasure that fits this description, so I can give it a try," Han Li said with a nod .

"Haha, I wouldn't lie to you about something like this, Fellow Daoist . However, make sure you strike only when the moment is right . Otherwise, if something goes wrong, it could harm you rather than benefit you," the demon beast cautioned .

"Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, I won't act recklessly," Han Li replied with a smile .

"I can see that you're not a rash individual, Fellow Daoist Han . Now then, I'm going to draw the heavenly lightning to me and prepare to transcend my tribulation . If it weren't for the fact that I'm proficient in some concealment secret techniques, the lightning tribulation would've descended from the moment that I emerged from the cauldron . " The Endless Sky Beast heaved a faint sigh before slowly hovering up into the air .

Han Li's heart stirred upon hearing this, and he immediately flew out of the formation he had just set up as a streak of azure light .

Blue light then flashed within his eyes as he stared intently at the demon beast through the layers of dense white mist .

After rising to an altitude of over 300 feet, the demon beast stopped and looked up into the sky . All of a sudden, a dull sound rang out from its nostrils, and azure light began to flash violently all over its body . At the same time, gusts of grey demonic winds were swept up around it, concealing its body within .

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this .

An earth-shattering roar then erupted from within the gusts of demonic wings, and a burst of powerful demonic Qi erupted into the heavens . The Endless Sky Beast seemed to have unleashed some type of secret technique that had made its body swell drastically to several times its original size .

It was putting its demonic Qi as an eighth grade demon beast on full display .

Within the span of a breath, a clap of thunder suddenly exploded in the cloudless sky . Immediately thereafter, gale-force winds were swept up in a radius of thousands of kilometers as dark clouds appeared from thin air, giving the sky an extremely dark and sinister appearance . At the same time, rain began to pelt down amid the rumbling thunderclaps .

Han Li couldn't help but click his tongue in wonder upon seeing this .

As far as he was aware, this barren land was known as the dead land as it had always been an extremely dry place . It was often the case that this land would experience no rainfall for stretches of several decades . However, as soon a the Endless Sky Beast had unleashed its demonic Qi, the climate here had been completely transformed . It appeared that its metamorphosis stage lightning tribulation really wasn't something to be scoffed at .

The dark clouds in the air before tumble and surged drastically as arcs of lightning as thick as human arms surfaced within the dark clouds . Each and every flash of lightning was followed by an astonishing clap of thunder . A series of massive lightning nets gradually took shape .

Han Li pursed his lips and narrowed his eyes as he looked on from below .

Right at this moment, the demon beast within the formation let loose an almighty roar .

As a result, the grey demonic winds became several times more powerful, transforming into a greyish-white hurricane that rose straight up into the sky, as if it were threatening to plunge into the dark clouds and eradicate the lightning within .
