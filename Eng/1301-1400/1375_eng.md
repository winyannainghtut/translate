Chapter 1375: Black Leaves Forest

At first glance, the two huge beasts appeared to be giant apes . But their green fur was exceptionally long and they had three black eyes . They were continuously flickering around out of vigilance .

Han Li calmly observed them as they walked past . After they were farther away, he blurred and arrived at a distant tree .

When he watched them disappear, a trace of bewilderment appeared on his face .

The two patrolling beasts weren’t wood tribe beings . Why would they appear in the forest? They were intelligent as they were carrying huge copper prongs .

Could it be another unknown tribe?

After some thought, Han Li couldn't help but shake his head .

According to what he knew, the wood tribe was extremely xenophobic . They wouldn't allow other foreign tribes to boldly strut in their territory . Could it be beasts of war bred by the wood tribe? Han Li thought .

So-called beasts of war were spirit beasts of another name . Like humans and demons, through secret techniques these foreign tribes were able to control spirit beasts . Other foreign tribes understood they could put ancient beasts to their own devices after training them with medicine or anything else .

Of course, various races had differing talents . The beasts they could train and control differed . Not all of them could tame the same beasts .

The shadow tribe’s two-headed Shen Beast was a powerful war beast exclusive to their tribe . He also reckoned only the shadow tribe had a method of taming it .

As for the wood tribe, he wasn’t aware that they had any war beasts . Could this be a new development?

Han Li held curious thoughts for half a day before eventually putting the matter away .

Since the two beasts with long green fur passed him by without discovering him, he reckoned, they would be the kind to have thick flesh and skin . He had nothing to fear .

As a result, Han Li’s body blurred and he vanished .

. . .

A day later, below a huge tree in the forest, Han Li was sullenly looking at eight long-furred beasts in front of him .

They were different from the two ape-like beasts he had seen before . Not only were their bodies smaller by half, but their bodies were fire-red and their furred hands carried sparkling black wolf fangs, not copper prongs .

These eight huge beasts were all glaring at Han Li with bared fangs .

Han Li smirked .

Originally, he believed the beasts to have extremely dim spiritual senses . But when the pack of beasts brushed past him, they discovered him hiding behind a tree and immediately surrounded him .

Han Li looked at the black-lit third eye on the beasts’ forehead and frowned . He faintly sensed something .

When he saw those green-haired beasts, their third eye was closed .

At that moment, the eight red beasts let out a roar and leaped at him . They fiercely waved their fangs .

Their fangs immediately lit up in a layer of green light released fierce winds in Han Li’s direction .

Han Li raised his brow but showed no intention of blocking them . He simply waved his sleeve .

Eight small golden swords appeared and they blurred, quickly coiling around each of the beasts .

Pfff . Their heads rolled off like cabbages .

When the eight swords trembled and returned to Han Li, the corpses were already pooling their green blood on the ground .

Han Li waved his other sleeve at the corpses and released fireballs upon each of the corpses .

In a few crackles, the bodies immediately turned to ash .

With that done, Han Li expressionlessly blurred and he left a string of afterimages as he headed deeper into the forest .

But not long after he left, two green streaks appeared on a huge tree near what had happened . They were two foot-long green eyes . The green eyes emotionlessly looked around and stared in the direction that Han Li disappeared .

In an area myriad of kilometers away, under the concealment of other unremarkable trees, another pair of green eyes opened .

The pair of green eyes silently stared at the air three hundred meters away . A man and a woman were standing shoulder to shoulder . The man wore green robes while the woman wore black robes . They were Long Dong and Xiao Hong .

The two were communicating something through voice transmission . On the ground near them, there were a dozen green and red-furred beasts .

“Brother Long, those creatures seem weak, but they can see through our concealment techniques . My Illusion Haze Flag is supposed to conceal me even from similar grade cultivators . ” Xiao Hong said through voice transmission .

With a trace of bewilderment on his face, Long Dong replied, “It should have something to do with their third eye . Beasts that are born with multiple eyes tend to carry particular abilities . In that case, we should be careful . ”

“That is most likely it . Let’s go . We need to catch up with that girl . Otherwise, it’ll fall into her hands . ” She said with a sullen face .

Long Dong strangely smiled and eerily said, “Hehe! I didn’t expect you and that girl to take on this assignment with a secret plan . It is a pity the item has little value to our Long Clan . However, Fairy should forget about our previous agreement . The item goes to you, but she goes to me . ”

Xiao Hong snorted and said, “Although I am also interested in her Heavenly Phoenix Blood, the item is significant in the eyes of the clan . I know what is more important . ”

“Hehe, that’s good . Let’s go!” Long Dong chuckled .

After the two blurred, they disappeared .

Off in another direction, a strange white image was quickly shooting past the forest floor . It was travelling at unbelievable speeds .

. . .

The Black Leaves Forest was a secretive place with many layers of restrictions . Under a silver tree that paled in size to the rest of the rest, several dark figures were sitting cross-legged . One of them suddenly opened their eyes, revealing dark green eyes that shined with golden light . It let out short strange cries .

The other figures opened their eyes as well . Among them was a figure that was far taller than the others . It let out a dignified tone as if it were asking something .

The figure that first screeched immediately crouched down and began to respectfully . answer .

With that done, the towering figure uttered a string of commands .

The others immediately rose and surrounded the small tree .

The towering figure let out a roar and pointed at the small tree next to him . A green light suddenly shot out and entered the tree .

Suddenly, the silver tree trembled and several silver eyes opened from it . At the same time, it released several bowl-sized silver beams of light, striking each of the figures .

When the beams of light struck them, their bodies grew vague and they disappeared .

. . .

Han Li naturally was unaware of what was happening in other parts of the forest . He was stealthily traveling .

His path forward became extraordinarily smooth . Apart from occasionally encountering long-furred beasts, he didn’t see anything else, wood tribe beings included .

While this was cause for joy, Han Li couldn't help but feel somewhat suspicious .

But after a brief thought, he believed this to be nothing out of the ordinary, given the grand size of the forest .

And as the assignment was the key to his much needed Earth Cleansing Pills, he couldn't abandon the mission now that he was this deep into the forest .

So even with a trace of unease in his mind, Han Li continued forward with a somewhat cautious attitude .

. . .

Two days later, Han Li stopped on top of a thin tree branch . His body seemed to weigh nothing more than a calm wind . He looked at a three hundred meter tall hill not far away .

There were sparsely any trees or vegetation on the hill . All the trees were ancient as well .

Han Li stared at the hill for a long while before flipping his hand, summoning pitch-black triangular spell disc .

The heart of the spell plate flickered with white light .

He lowered his head to look at the plate for a moment and then looked at the hill in the distance . He then struck the plate with an azure spell seal .

Black light suddenly lit up from it and a white light speck flew out and circled the plate . It released a thin white thread, pointing at an ancient tree on the hill .

Han Li’s eyes stirred .

The ancient tree indicated was half shriveled . It was over a hundred meters tall and its surface was scorched black as if it were struck by lightning . The bottom half of the tree was yellow and its roots were green .

Han Li looked at it for a moment and narrowed his eyes . He slowly released his spiritual sense and examined his surroundings .

A short while later, he opened his eyes and wore a trace of relief .

He was alone .

Han Li didn’t immediately set off . He narrowed his eyes in thought, deciding to wave his sleeve first . He summoned several balls that shimmered silver and opened his mouth to spit out fist-sized silver firebirds .

The birds circled his body and turned a foot long . They flew into his palm and consumed each of the silver beads . Then in the flash, they burrowed into the ground .

With that done, Han Li swept his hand over his storage bracelet, producing a set of azure spell flags . He wordlessly tossed them in front of him .

Eight green streaks shot out and disappeared all around the hill .

Han Lie continued, forming a hand gesture and softly uttering an incantation .

A layer of green light surrounded the hill, but soon, Han Li commanded it with a spell seal, and it turned invisible with a few flashes .

When Han Li saw this, he sighed and he leaped off . Blurring several times before arriving at the edge of the hill .

In a green flash, he disappeared .
