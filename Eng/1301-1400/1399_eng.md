Chapter 1399: The Yaksha King

Senior Zhu’s face turned pale . He wasn’t able to see through the cultivation of the golden-eyed Yaksha, but with a trace of hope in his heart, he asked, “The Yaksha Tribe! Our species have yet to fight . There was no reason to disturb our treasure hunt . What is the reason for surrounding us?”

“Attack!”

The order came from the strongest of the hundred Yakshas, a woman that gave Senior Zhu an enchanting smile . However, her voice was unmistakably icy .

The surrounding Yakshas immediately brandished their huge axes and blades, launching fierce streaks of light from every direction towards the surrounded cultivators .

The situation was similar to how the human cultivators had launched full-scale attacks on the Black Blood Ants earlier, but with the positions reversed .

Although there was a large difference in numbers and powers between the humans and the foreign beings, Senior Zhu and the cultivators weren't about to succumb at the first blow . In their terror, the cultivators released their strongest treasures, blocking the barrage of attacks with their utmost power, causing a clash of rainbow lights . Among the cultivators, there where many that used evasion and concealment techniques to directly blur through space as they attempted to flee .

In furious alarm, Senior Zhu blurred and arrived at the beautiful woman’s side . The two clasped palms and blue-red light flickered from either of them . They then spat out a small flag .

The two small flags were densely covered in unknown talisman characters . As soon as the flags appeared, they glared with light and fused into one, creating a red-blue barrier that enveloped them both .

At that moment, the blade streaks swept through the air, wildly slashing at the barrier and leaving white marks .

In huge rumbling explosions, the streaks ruptured largely .

The human cultivators forcefully blocked the attacks for a moment with their various techniques and treasures, but soon, the attacks pierced through and completely submerged them .

Miserable screams shouted in succession after the explosions .

But several huge bladelights ceased attacking the group of cultivators . Instead, they shifted directions to the space far away .

White arcs strangely cross the air and crimson light lit up through the air . Several split corpses then appeared and fell .

These concealed cultivators weren’t able to escape the attention of the Yakshas and were easily killed .

At that moment, the light that the cultivators amassed turned dim .

What were originally over ten cultivators were reduced to a sparse six . Among them included the two Spatial Tempering cultivators .

Their protective treasure was truly powerful . It was able to block the combined attacks of the Yakshas . As for the others they had turned to ash .

Regardless of whether it was the Spatial Tempering cultivators’ huge flag, or the other cultivators’ several treasures, their light had turned dim with small cracks appearing on several of them .

It was clear these treasures were damaged and couldn't sustain another barrage .

But having survived the Yakshas’ initial attack, they weren’t about to sit still and accept death .

Senior Zhu and the beautiful woman pointed at the huge flag in front of them .

It spun as it turned back into two and brightly glowed . It released huge trembles before rupturing simultaneously .

A red and a blue wind appeared and soared to the sky in the blink of an eye .

Senior Zhu and the beautiful woman blurred, turning into two streaks of light as they fused with the two gales that appeared . Afterwards, they activated their techniques turning the two gales into a kilometer tall tornado . Thunder rang through the air as it overbearingly charged through the sky .

When the Yakshas blocking their way saw the frightening power of the storm, they were thrown into disarray, even with their violent cruel nature .

The remaining humans were delighted when they saw this and they took advantage of this opportunity to chase after the storm .

The other cultivators clearly understood that unless they took this last lifeline, their lives would be forfeit .

Wherever the blue-red tornado brushed past, the nearby space would become blurred and twisted, a clear sign of its might . When the storm charged towards the group of Yakshas, two huge black shadows appeared above the tornado . Before the other cultivators realized what was going on, four explosions sounded . Four waves of a huge invisible force struck the top of the storm .

The tornado trembled and was forcefully blocked in its original location .

Originally, there were a couple of two-hundred-meter-tall Yakshas that had remained suspended in the air . They had blurred and strangely appeared at both sides of the tornado . Their building-sized fists smashed down with immense force and block the tornado in its path .

Senior Zhu and the beautiful woman were greatly alarmed . Without another thought, they immediately utilized the entirety of this magic power . The blue-red tornado trembled and increased by nearly half its size in an attempt to force their way through .

However, the two giant Yakshas were like mountains . Red light flashed through both their eyes as their arms blurred and bodies blurred .

Countless afterimages blurred at the giant fists pummeled either side of the tornado . In a short moment, the tornado was thoroughly suppressed by the barrage of attacks .

When the nearby cultivators saw this, they were aghast and scattered, fleeing in every direction .

At that moment, the sound of splitting air sounded from the air around them as countless blade streaks whistled .

The hundred Yakshas surrounding the cultivators released their second wave of attacks .

Not only did the remaining cultivators wear expressions of terror, but Senior Zhu and the beautiful woman had bloodlessly pale complexions .

A huge world-shaking eruption sounded filling up the entire area .

. . .

Deep underground, Han Li was wrapped in flickering grey light as he quickly fled .

Strangely enough, there was silver-grey light that lit up his surroundings and continuously rubbed against his protective light, creating sparks of friction .

Han Li wore an extremely grave expression .

Although he didn't emerge from the ground like the other cultivators, he had recently heard a huge explosion from above ground . Even as deep under as he was, he still sensed the vibrations . Its fearsome power was clear to see .

Could it be that the other cultivators were completely exterminated?

Han Li felt his heart tremble .

When the underground cave had collapsed entirely along with the mountain, the cultivators were in the middle of the spirit magnet vein and didn’t dare to flee through the earth . They could only rise to the ground . But Han Li with his Divine Essensefused Light, he was able to restrain the five elements and many of the world’s magnetic restrictions . As such, he took the risk of fleeing underground .

In addition, when the mountain collapsed, his immense spiritual sense also detected very powerful foreign beings above them and he didn’t dare to delay . He immediately covered himself in the Essensefused Light and he dived underground .

But after a short moment underground, the injured Blue-eyed True Toads emerged from their underground cave, right towards Han Li .

With such a fortunate matter knocking on his door, he didn’t allow them to pass him by . With no regard for his magic power, he released many of his abilities and exterminated the True Toads . He then recovered their bodies and head on his way .

As for the Thousand Heart Flowers that Senior Zhu was looking for, he didn’t have the time to look for them .

The spirit magnet vein was far more fearsome that Han Li anticipated, but his Divine Essensefused Light was nothing to scoff at either . By using the power of the Divine Essensefused Mountain, he was able to forcefully protect himself and block the huge attractive force deep in the mountain .

Although the foreign tribes were powerful, they wouldn’t dare to chase him into the earth as they would be in range of the spirit magnet vein .

After some thought, Han Li felt relieved .

It was a pity that he couldn't use his spiritual sense to scout for him as the spirit magnet vein blocked it, or else he would feel even more assured .

As Han Li thoughts whirled through his head, he eventually traveled thousands of kilometers underground and found that the silver light surrounding him began to grow dim .

The silver light eventually disappeared and Han Li’s expression stirred . Feeling more at ease, he swept his spiritual sense above ground .

There was an unfamiliar valley above him surrounded by three mountains and had only once entrance . It was dense with foliage and didn’t have anything out of the ordinary . He could sense the aura of foreign beings of huge ancient beasts .

Han Li repeatedly swept his spiritual sense several times before finally feeling at ease . He then tunneled up in an azure streak .

When his surroundings lit up, he withdrew his flight light and floated a hundred meters in the air .

When Han Li swept his gaze around and his sights focused on a nearby area, he felt a cold chill shake his body and hold him in place .

Above a huge tree three hundred meters away, there were two tall devilish Yakshas . They stood there looking in different directions .

The two Yakshas had a pair of huge wings and they were over thirty meters tall . When they glanced at Han Li, they appeared greatly surprised .

But what left Han Li dumbstruck wasn’t that he saw the two Yakshas, but that he wasn’t able to sense their aura in the slightest . When his spiritual sense swept past them, he hadn’t detected them in the slightest . It was as if nothing was there .

Han Li clearly realized what this meant .

The two Yakshas possessed cultivation far beyond his own . They were likely the so-called Yaksha kings .

As such, he couldn't help but hold his breath .

As Han Li inwardly cursed, the two Yakshas had yet to take any action . They simply looked at an area a kilometer away . A light flashed and another rainbow light shot out of the ground . There was another cultivator that appeared .

Han Li was stunned when he saw this .

The light that emerged from the ground was a dainty woman on top of a rainbow jade boat . She was Lady Xiao .

When she saw Han Li, her expression lit up and thought to call out to him . But when she saw the two motionless Yakshas, her complexion paled .
