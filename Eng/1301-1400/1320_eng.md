Chapter 1320: Fight for the Spirit Land

The fat man let out an inward sigh of relief and thanked the purple-robed man with a smile . He used the jade pendant on a speck of light that said ‘4’ .

The number that said ‘4’ was touched by the pendant’s azure light and it blurred to a ‘5’ .

This was a location in the Jade Rapid Mountains, the place with the densest spiritual Qi .

When the other sitting cultivators saw this, their expressions vastly changed . A few of the others had a similar idea to him and now had no choice but to take a change of plans .

Because the fat man was a late Deity Transformation-stage cultivator, his cultivation and words seemed to weigh down on the other cultivators .

Now that the fat man had chosen, he returned to his own seat and wanted to see what the others would pick .

Because of his choice, the remaining cultivators eventually stood up to make their choice, both taking an area at Heavenly Sound Mountain, one without any people and one with .

Once those two made their selection, they immediately headed down .

The remaining cultivators each frowned as if unable to come to a decision .

At that moment, Han Li suddenly stood up and walked to the purple-robed man .

The other cultivators were faintly startled .

After all, Han Li had only recently arrived, so it was unexpected for him to quickly come to a decision .

Han Li stroked his storage bracelet and took out a white jade box into his hand . Then with a smile, he handed them to the large purple-robed man with his own jade pendant .

The purple-robed man didn’t immediately take the jade box . Instead, he glanced at Han Li and said, “I heard there was a newly ascended cultivator that arrived in the city . Are you that fellow surnamed Han?”

“Senior is well informed . That is me . ” Han Li’s heart trembled, but he showed none of his shock on his face .

“In that case, this should be the first time you’ve picked a cave residence . You won’t need to pay a price and can choose a spirit land . ”

“Many thanks, Senior!” Han Li’s face blanked and he quickly withdrew the jade box with a smile .

When the cultivators heard that Han Li was a newly ascended, they glanced at him with an odd expression .

It seemed newly ascended cultivators were a special existence in the city .

The large man quickly examined Han Li’s pendant and gave it back to him with a nod .

Han Li didn’t hesitate and waved his pendant over an uninhabited area .

The azure light passed through it and marked the area with ‘1’ .

An uproar was raised when they saw the area Han Li chose .

The area Han Li picked was an area on Jade Rapid Mountain with the most inferior spiritual Qi .

It wasn’t strange for a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator to choose that mountain range, but there were other areas on the mountain range with no one as well . Han Li instead choose the most unremarkable area with the least spiritual Qi . This left them bewildered .

The spirit land’s sole benefit was that to make up for the land’s deficient spiritual Qi, they gave a larger plot of land to make up for it . The land spanned thousands of kilometers, several times in size compared to the other spirit lands on the mountain range .

But everyone knew that the quality of the land was directly related to the amount of spiritual Qi on the land . No matter how wide the land may be, the medicine and ores would certainly be lacking . It is even worse for the cultivator in question .

In the purple-robed man’s surprise, he glanced at the man for a long while and frowned, “You truly chose that as your cave residence . You should know this selection can’t be changed for a hundred years . ”

Han Li calmly answered, “I’ve only arrived in the spirit realm . I want to place to stay for the time being, I don’t wish to fight over space with other Fellow Daoists . Although the area is lacking, there is no one else there . ”

The purple-robed man then glanced at Han Li with an odd expression and waved his hand . With his originally lazy voice, he said, “If those are your thoughts, then so be it . In any case, after you mark it, no one else will be able to change it . ”

Han Li saluted him without further concern and returned to his seat, planning on staying a while longer .

Then, another cultivator stood up and selected the same area as the large purple-robed man .

But then, footsteps clapped and someone entered the second floor unattended by a maid .

When the cultivators on the second floor saw this person, their expressions all changed . The fat man with the largest cultivation, on the other hand, looked at him with bright eyes and he called out, “So it was Fellow Daoist Weng! I didn’t know you were interested in contesting spirit lands!”

The person who entered was a blue-robed man with a headband . He had sharp slanted eyebrows, giving him a menacing impression .

He glanced at the fat man and smiled, “Hehe, If Brother Jin has come to change his cave residence, then so can I . ”

This person was a mid-Deity Transformation stage cultivator, but he spoke to the late-stage fat man with a friendly tone . This caused Han Li’s heart to stir and take another look at the blue-robed man .

After all, at this stage of cultivation, every difference in grade signified a vast disparity in power . Of course, those like him that possessed spirit treasures, created heavenly flames from devouring spirits, and practiced heaven-defying abilities like Divine Essensefused Light were the exception .

Since the blue-robed man acted so familiarly with the late-stage cultivator, he should belong in this category .

“Little Brother Weng must be joking . You hold a top grade spirit land . What would you exchange it for . ” The fat man stroked his chin and wore a trace of confusion .

“Hehe, I’ve been recently cultivating a secret technique that doesn’t need too much spiritual Qi . I require a larger area, or it will be difficult to cultivate . I'm going to change it for the time being . ” The blue-robed man replied with a shock .

“So it was like that,” the fat man said with understanding, but it was unknown if he truly believed him .

When Han Li heard the two talk, he frowned for a brief moment .

The blue-robed man took several steps to the purple-robed man and saluted him, “I pay my respects to Martial Uncle Jiao . My master sends his regards . ”

“From that old eccentric’s rotten character, why would he say that? Nevertheless, you master hide from six greater tribulations already . I fear he won’t be able to hide from the seventh, the large man said with a cold laugh .

When the blue-robed man heard the purple-robed man’s reply, he wore an embarrassed expression, but he soon answered, “My master has been secluded for two hundred years . He is preparing to forge a spirit treasure that can withstand the next calamity . ”

“A spirit treasure? It seems your master’s luck is quite good . Last time, he had his spirit treasures destroyed to withstand the tribulation and he managed to gather enough materials for another . In that case, your master does have a chance at surviving the next one . Alright, enough of that . I am on duty . Quickly make your choice . ” The purple-robed man’s expression sank and he said no further .

“As you wish . The blue-robed man quickly swept his gaze past the man, and looked at several areas with a number and his expression sank .

“Someone actually chose such a remote area on Jade Rapid Mountains . ” Not daring to ask the purple-robed man any questions, he turned to the fat man and pointed at an area on the map, “Brother Jin, you’ve been here a while . Do you know who chose that place?”

When the fat man saw where he pointed, an odd expression appeared on his face and he unconsciously glanced in Han Li’s direction .

The blue-robed man quickly understood what the fat man’s face meant . He promptly turned around and closely examined Han Li .

When he saw Han Li’s cultivation was only at early-stage, he wore an arrogant expression and he coldly said, “so you’re the one who chose the spirit land!”

After a moment of silence, Han Li replied, “And you also want it . ”

The blue-robed man snorted and eerily said, “My secret technique can only be cultivated in a suitable place . If you’re smart, you’ll renounce your claim . Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless in our fight . ” His threat was clear to see .

Han Li remained silent .

In order to avoid a fight, he intentionally picked an area with sparse spiritual Qi . He wanted to avoid provoking any problems as he only had interests in cultivating . He didn’t want to make any enemies that would disturb him .

He completely didn’t expect this plan to backfire and have someone come knocking on his door . Han Li found this matter to be truly laughable .

With blue light shining from his eyes, he took a quick glance at the others .

The large purple-robed man still lazily sat in his seat and had yet to raise his eyes . It appeared he didn’t really care . As for the other cultivators, they looked at him with schadenfreude .

“Senior, if I renounce my choice, will I be able to pick another area . ” Han Li calmly asked the purple-robed man .

“You cannot . There are only so many spirit lands . Everyone will only have one opportunity to fight for it . If you lose, you’ll have to contest an empty land in another hundred years . ” He replied expressionlessly .

When Han Li heard this, he sighed .

To delay the maturation of his spirit medicines and creation of spirit pills for a hundred years was something he found intolerable .

To the side, the blue-robed man sneered and said, “Even if you have to wait a hundred years, you’ll be able to pick another area . But if you don’t listen to me, hehe . . . ’

When Han Li heard him, he raised his brow and smiled .

“I will not agree to your request . From the way I see it, it’d be best for you to look for a different area to cultivate . I don’t wish to injure you . If I were to make a mistake . . . ”

Han Li spoke casually, and although he only finished half his sentence, his blunt words were extremely obvious .

The spectators were stunned .
