Chapter 1332: Savage Beastman

“A Savage Beastman! Quickly kill him! We cannot allow him to join with the beast . ” When they saw this strange person, Daoist Priest Man shouted in terror .

When the others heard this, they were aghast .

Without another thought, they released rarely seen ancient treasures in streaks of light .

In a moment, the beastman and the ancient beast was pelted by attacks .

Han Li saw that his subordinates were truly fearful of this foreign tribe .

To the confusion of the cultivators in the squad, Han Li still hadn’t taken action . As the beastman was on the verge of transformation, he continued to float in the air with his hands behind the back, leaving the fight completely to them .

As the cultivators felt somewhat stressed, the beastman suddenly counterattacked, blocking them from asking Han Li .

The beastman let out a strange laugh and its shoulder blurred, creating a yellow tornado in the direction of the cultivators . As for the ancient beast, its body began to turn exceptionally green, soon extended its tentacles .

They spread out in green blurs, striking at the air along with the tornado .

Regardless of the magic treasures’ attacks, be they lightning, flame, or swordlight, they were all swept into the tornado and disappeared . And when they were struck by the tentacles, they were repelled .

The cultivators acted in a panic, unable to cope with what was happening .

As Han Li looked on without lifting a finger, no one noticed the small silver fish in the pond had begun to form two orbs . They sparkled with silver light as if it in the form of silver eyes .

Meanwhile, the calm surface of the water began to violently stir, exposing a transparent ten-meter-large mouth . It had crystalline ice-like fangs .

The pond had turned into a monster with a transparent body .

At that moment the huge transparent monster stirred and pounced at Han Li in midair .

Not only was it transparent, but its movements were silent as if it were formless .

Han Li silently looked at the battle that was unfolding between the beastman as if he hadn’t noticed himself being attacked .

Just as the transparent beast was ten meters away from Han Li, its silver eyes flashed and it bared its fangs at Han Li .

Grey light flashed from Han Li’s back, and countless thin lines of Divine Essencefused Light directly shot at it .

Alarmed, the huge beast thought to dodge, but it was too late!

With the sound of pattering rain, the grey lines pierced through the huge beast’s body and twisted, firmly wrapped around the beast’s body .

Han Li’s body then blurred, turning to the huge beast . With a brief glance, he opened his mouth and spat out a small black mountain .

It twirled in the air, surging several times in size until it was a three-hundred-meter tall mountain above the transparent beast .

The beast knew things were far from good and it promptly shook its body violently in an attempt to escape .

Unfortunately, it was a water-attributed beast . With a body of the five elements, it couldn't hope to escape the bindings of the Divine Essensefused Light .

The grey lines simply swayed a bit and tightened .

At last, Han Li uttered an incantation .

A roiling sound filled the air and the mountain dropped, crushing the transparent beast underneath .

The impact vibrated the air .

The mountain crushed the transparent beast into the earth, ensuring it was entirely trapped .

He then took an expressionless look at the beast .

However, a loud scream from behind him caught his attention and he slowly turned around with a frown .

The cultivators were still busy in their battle with the beastman, but when the beastman saw the transparent monster restrained by Han Li, it let out a panicked roar .

The beastman no longer controlled the tornado or tangled with the green-eyed man . Instead, he slapped the beast below him and quickly sank inside the giant beast .

“Not good, he’s about to merge with it . Quickly stop him!” The large green-eyed man rejoiced at seeing Han Li silently restrain the other beast, but his face grew tense at seeing what the beastman had done .

Youth Ying and the others were all alarmed and poured as much of their spiritual power into their treasures as they could, doubling all their efforts into attacking .

But even without direction, the tornado still hindered their attacks for a time . In that delay, the skin of the huge beast shined with green light and bumps appeared on the surface of its body .

First a pair of legs, then hands appeared . Finally, its body lengthened and a bald head grew .

Under the control of the beastman, the huge beast turned into a black giant that was a hundred meters tall . Its body was covered in purple-black scales and it had ominous green lanterns for eyes .

When it appeared, it wordlessly raised its hand into the air and fiercely pounded down with black light flashing from its fist .

Booms thundered and a dozen magic treasures were crushed into dust . A majority of them, however, managed to escape high into the air with a wail .

Fairy Xu raised her brow and snorted . Only she deemed to continue her attack and pointed at her snow-white flying sword .

Letting out a keen ring, it turned ten-meters-long and blurred, instantly disappearing .

In the following moment, it reappeared twenty meters above the giant and fiercely chopped down .

She actually planned on beheading the giant in a lone effort .

But greatly against her expectations, the giant was incredibly fast despite its huge size . As soon as the sword moved, it opened its mouth and blew back the sword with a gale .

Soon, it firmly grabbed ahold of the sword with its black-purple hand .

A malevolent expression appeared on the giant’s face as it pressed its other palm against the sword .

It appeared to want to destroy the flying sword .

Fairy Xu’s face turned pale .

The sword was her personally bonded magic treasure . If it was destroyed, she would suffer backlash from her mental bond with it .

She was executing spell seals in utmost haste to free it, but despite its violent trembling and the series of white icy Qi, the giant kept its grip steady .

The giant took a deep breath . Just as it was about to press down, space fluctuated nearby . A dense beam of black light struck the giant’s chest .

In a baffling display, the attack seemed trivially small compared to its giant body, but its tumble several steps back .

The black beam of light only appeared for an instant, and from where it appeared followed a silver flame bird . The fist-sized bird dived at the giant with its wings spread .

Again, the difference in size was incredible, but it stepped back with a fearful expression upon seeing it . Rather than standing firm, it immediately turned around in a mad run .

The giant only took two steps before a sharp wind sounded from below the nearby ground . A dozen red threads flew out and surrounded the giant’s step . Red light glowed, turning into dense flaming ropes holding down the giant’s legs .

No longer able to move forward, the giant swiped down in furious alarm, wanting to break the flame ropes .

The silver flame bird never gave it the chance . It swooped forward at lightning speed and struck the giant’s back as a ball of silver flames .

A muffled crackle snapped, and silver fire spread as the giant was covered in oil . It spread quickly and lit it ablaze .

Yet unable to free itself, the giant could only scream in pain and swept yellow winds around itself, trying to extinguish the flames .

When yellow wind and silver flames touched one another, the wind itself seemed to be lit up . In only a few short breathes, the giant was thoroughly enveloped by both flames and ignited winds .

Soon, the screams stopped and the giant fell onto the ground . The body had been burned to a crisp, leaving no trace of the giant’s existence .

The black beam of light had unexpectedly appeared afterwards and arrived where the giant once was . The entire scene was witnessed by the squad of cultivators .

Although Han Li already used his Spirit Engulfing Flames once before on the sharp worms, it hadn’t been in a display as fearsome as this . Now that the cultivators had seen it used on the helpless beastman, they were all mesmerized with disbelief on their faces .

At that moment, Han Li blurred, arriving above the silver flames and beckoning to it .

The silver flames suddenly condensed into a ball and returned back to him in the form of a firebird . As for the fire ropes, they returned into his sleeve in read threads .

Han Li swept his sights to the transparent beast being suppressed by the Divine Essensefused Mountain, and said, “Take back the Savage Beastman and have the Foreign Spirit Hall deal with it when we go back to the city . ”

“Yes! Junior Ma will immediately retrieve it!” The heart of the large green-eyed man trembled and he acknowledged the command . Then with a flip of his hand, he released a white gourd .

The gourd was inscribed with large quantities of silver runes . It is a specially refined magic tool meant for temporarily detaining foreign beings .

Regardless of the tribe of their many abilities, so long as they aren’t at true spirit grade, they can be captured by the gourd .

Of course, the beastman had now lost its strength and was completely motionless . It no longer put up a resistance .
