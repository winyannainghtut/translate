Chapter 1371: Fierce Desert Battle

Long Dong exterminated the two green shadows with ease and wordlessly waved his crimson sword .

Suddenly, the sword dissolved into a deep red cloud of blood essence and flowed back into his palms where it soon vanished .

He let out a long sigh and his face turned dark red, followed by a bloodless white as if he had lost much blood .

He quickly took out a scarlet bottle from his storage bracelet and tossed out a scarlet medicine pill into his mouth . Then without further delay, he quickly sped off .

At another corner of the desert, a young white-robed woman was standing at the top of a desert mound . Ten meters away, there were four ice-cold corpses .

There wasn’t a single wound present on any of the bodies . They simply laid there without the slightest trace of life .

The woman stroked a slender jade bottle in her hand and wore a cute mysterious smile on her face . Suddenly, her body soared into the air in a golden streak . Several flashes later, she vanished .

In an area myriads of kilometers away, azure-white lightning repeatedly sparked through the air . A black cloud several kilometers away chased after him . Although it didn’t appear very fast, it was able to accurately follow the lightning no matter the distance .

In the blink of an eye, the chase continued for a couple of hundred kilometers . Suddenly, the black cloud trembled and disappeared . A moment later, the black cloud blinked forward half a kilometer and continued its pursuit .

Suddenly, the azure-white lightning jumped forward and disappeared in white light . It traveled half a kilometer away and widened the gap once more .

The pursuit continued relentlessly .

Of course, the winged figure riding the lightning was Han Li .

He was tightly frowning and his gaze appeared gloomy .

Not long ago, he discovered the old Daoist was chasing after him in a cloud of black Qi . He then immediately spread his Thunderstorm Wings and made use of his Nine Gale Transformations to their fullest extent .

However, the black cloud was not only amazingly fast, but it also could blink forward .

The two remained in pursuit despite the vast distance they traveled .

Although the desert was vast, foreign tribes often roamed it . With Han Li being so closely pursued, it would be incredibly troublesome if he caught the attention of other foreign tribes .

As for the vitality intensive Blood Shadow Evasion, he had already used it once . He was unwilling to use it again unless he absolutely needed to . After all, the desert is filled with dangers . He would need to preserve his vitality in preparation for when he was past the Southern Skyline .

It appeared he would have no choice but to battle with the shadow tribe being .

The shadow being had possessed the body of a mid-stage Spatial Tempering cultivator, clearly illustrating his high position in the shadow tribe . He was most likely a crimson shadow, a being equivalent to a Spatial Tempering cultivator .

If it were the high-grade being from another tribe, he might feel some fear, but he had many abilities that were effective against them . He had some confidence in fighting them .

Furthermore, after he entered Deep Heaven City, he cultivated and refined several techniques and treasures . He had yet to test their might . He figured he would test their effectiveness on this crimson shadow .

With that thought quickly appearing in his mind, he blinked again and his wings trembled . He suddenly came to a stop .

As a result, the black cloud quickly arrived three hundred meters behind Han Li . It appeared that the cloud planned on directly pouncing at him .

This came as no surprise .

The shadow tribe’s most powerful techniques were consuming the primal souls of other tribes and directly controlling their bodies . They would also be able to use a majority of the body’s techniques .

Of course, Han Li wasn’t about to allow the shadow to arrive near him . Without a word, he slapped his hands together and opened them .

A heaven shaking thunder roared . A bowl-sized bolt of lightning ruptured from his hands, directly targeting the oncoming black cloud .

A yelp sounded and the black Qi suddenly blinked, disappearing into a nearby spatial void .

Han Li coldly snorted and suddenly split open a crimson slit from his forehead . His law Law Destruction Eye opened and released a black light that vanished in a flash .

A deafening rupture sounded, violently shaking a space a hundred meters away . Wrapped in the black Qi, the old Daoist blurred and reappeared . He shouted in surprise, “The Law Destruction Eye! You actually cultivate that ability!?”

Han Li’s lip twitched and he remained silent . Suddenly, he cast a spell seal and the dense bolt of lightning curved, fiercely striking at the old Daoist when he least expected it .

The old Daoist cursed and thought to dodge when Han Li’s eyes brightly flashed blue . He could only let out a sharp breath in response .

The sound wasn’t loud, but he felt as if the ringing of a huge bell was echoing through his eyes . He felt tearing pain through his mind and his body slowed .

Thunder clapped . Golden lightning struck the black Qi, spreading thousands of thin arcs through it . In an instant, the black Qi grew violently unstable .

At that same moment, a huge frog’s croak sounded from the black Qi .

The black Qi roiled and condensed underneath the old Daoist, turning into a strange two-headed beast with snake heads and a frog’s body . Its four crimson eyes glared at Han Li with rage .

Han Li couldn't help but pause upon seeing this .

The black Qi protecting the old Daoist was actually a transformed beast .

After receiving the lightning strike, the old Daoist’s body recovered and he eerily glared at Han Li, “Good, very good! A trifling Deity Transformation cultivator was able to shock my mind . That ability was quite surprising . You may as well try to use it again!”

Han Li frowned . His full-powered lightning bolt was received by the strange beast, not the shadow tribe being . If the strike hit the shadow being, he definitely would’ve been harmed .

As for the Soulfright Thorn, he wasn’t foolish enough to use it again . It was only effective in a surprise attack . As the shadow being’s soul was stronger than his, it wouldn’t have any effect .

Han Li didn’t say anything further . He raised his hand and revealed a pitch-black palm . He pointed it in the old Daoist’s direction .

Suddenly, the space above the old Daoist began to warp and a small black mountain appeared .

The mountain twirled in the air, abruptly turning three-hundred-meters tall . It brightly shined grey and released rings grey light downward .

A harsh expression appeared on the old Daoist’s face and he waved his sleeve . A transparent crystalline half-foot-long blade appeared .

The blade sliced at the air, releasing a dazzling streak .

Zap . The blade streak fiercely cut through the grey rings and struck at the base of the huge mountain .

A loud drone sounded like a gong being struck .

The mountain didn’t move and the blade streak vanished .

The old Daoist’s face stirred . Before he could do anything else, Han Li stretched out his other hand, revealing a pure-white palm . He stretched his fingers, releasing five bone skull rings .

Five huge skulls appeared around the old Daoist . They simultaneously opened their mouths and spat out an icy flame . They merged into five-colored light and instantly submerged the old Daoist’s body .

The old Daoist wore a smirk, but after the flames drew close his body, his face vastly changed . Myriads of red streaks burst out from his body, wildly chopping at his surroundings in form of a red lotus .

As the lotus stirred, the rainbow flames were split apart, unable to approach the old man in the slightest .

Han Li’s expression sank and he formed his hands together . He harshly roared and suddenly, his body wildly grew several times in size and pounced at the red lotus .

Several harsh streaks sounded . As the five skulls charged to the edge of the red lotus, five dazzling blade streaks chopped at the skulls, splitting them into two like bolts of lightning .

Soon after, the crimson lotus was thoroughly opened .

The rainbow flames were thoroughly extinguished by the red light and the old Daoist reappeared with a calm face .

With a loud ghostly wail, the five cleaved skulls became whole once more .

But they continued to wail as if they held the old Daoist in great fear .

Han Li took a shallow breath and gravely pointed at his pitch-black mountain a distance away .

The huge mountain rumble and fell straight down .

As the huge mountain pressed downward, the old Daoist appeared unfazed . He simply tapped his foot on the huge beast below him .

The two serpent heads widely opened their mouths and apt out a dense red blur at the huge mountain falling above them .

With a violent crack, the huge mountain swayed and began to fall to the side .

Han Li narrowed his eyes at the sight of this and his face grew unsightly .

The two serpent heads were able to spit out their tongues at such a great force, they were able to knock away his Essensefused Mountain .

Han Li gloomily reached out for the black mountain and five skulls, causing them to vanish .

Black and white light lit up from his palms, returning the color of their skin to normal .

“Hehe, Brat, you have many treasures, but you are delusional to face me with your meager magic power . It appears you have no other methods . Hand over your body to me . ” The old Daoist seemed to be impatient, but he took no further action . Instead, the serpent heads of the beast let out a sharp shriek .

Invisible waves scattered around them, spreading several kilometers away .

Rainbow light continued to flash nearby and soon, countless rare beast images began to take form . A few as large as a hill with some only ten meters long . Each of them looked ferocious and smelled strong . They all surrounded Han Li and stared at him with evil eyes .
