Chapter 1380: Mission Complete

The green-skinned woman continued her answer, “As for why you were ambushed, it was because the wood tribe’s higher echelon altered the scope of the Dream Sifting Tree’s detection . I fear they detected you as soon as you entered . Fortunately, the upper echelon of the wood tribe doesn’t view Black Leaves Forest with much importance . It only sent a single lower silver-tier wood spirit to oversee it . Otherwise, it would’ve been difficult for you to escape them . ”

The young white-robed woman, Ye Ying, slowly said, “So it was like that! Older Sister Chu, these last thousand years must’ve been hard on you . ”

“It’s nothing . These past few years in the wood tribe haven’t been spent in vain . I’ve grasped many of their secrets . I’ve even made connections in the tribe, but I am certain I am now exposed . I cannot continue to stay here . ”

Han Li felt his heart stir .

Ye Ying smiled, “Deep Heaven City is possible on the brink of another war . Even if nothing happens, the clan master plans on calling you back . With your current cultivation, there is no point in continuing to hide here . ”

However, her smile seemed to provoke her injuries and she coughed several times, causing her face to turn paler .

“Is the young master alright? How about you take another Phoenix Spirit Pill?” Ye Chu proposed with a tense expression .

“No need! There aren’t many left . I’ll leave them for something else . ” Ye Ying shook her head .

“What? Is Lady Ye heavily injured?” Han Li blinked .

Ye Ying curled her lip and unhappily said, “That silver-tier tree spirit landed a clean blow . Would you say the injury is grave?”

“If it is an ordinary internal injury, I have several medicine pills for that . Perhaps they’ll be useful . ” Han Li said with a calm tone . He then waved his sleeve and summoned several medicine pills in her direction .

Ye Ying raised her brow . She reached out for the air and summoned them into her grasp . She then opened them and took a few whiffs .

Having some medicinal knowledge, she wore an astonished expression and immediately uttered their names, “Wondrous Grass Pill, Hundred Blessings Pill, Returning Spirit Water . . . Brother Han is quite generous to present these sacred medicines to me . In that case, I won’t hold back . ”

With her status, Ye Ying could’ve prepared a few of them, but she felt disbelief that a Deity Transformation cultivator could take out so many of them in a single breath .

The young woman blinked and promptly opened the bottles, swallowing several of the pills, revealing her trust in Han Li .

Han Li felt some admiration for her decisive actions .

Of course, she most likely had some sort of secret technique, so she had no fear there was something wrong with the medicine pills .

After she swallowed the pills, color returned to Ye Ying’s face . Then, she glanced at Han Li and asked, “Ah yes, how did you find me? If I’m not mistaken, your invisibility talisman seems to be a silver rune talisman . Might I know its name? This is the first time I’ve seen such a high-grade silver rune talisman . ”

“I have a bit of experience with tracking techniques . As for the talisman, it is called the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman . It is something I unintentionally came across . Its effects are truly marvelous . I was quite astonished when you were able to see through it . May I know how you did it? I fear even a Spatial Tempering cultivator would have trouble seeing through it . ” Han Li smiled and returned her question with a question .

“I cultivate a technique that happens to penetrate most concealment techniques . It wasn’t odd that I could see through it . Brother Han need not take it to heart . ” Ye Ying pursed her lips into a mysterious smile .

When Han Li heard this, he could only wryly laugh .

Although he knew her answer was false, it was difficult to continue asking her about it .

Ye Ying then said, “There is still another matter! Older Sister Chu, you should be carrying the information on the Wood Tribe . We should take advantage of this moment to send it over to Deep Heaven City in case of any surprises . ”

“Yes, Young Master . ” The green-skinned woman promptly replied .

Han Li wore a calm expression, but he felt slight .

Ye Ying reached for her storage bracelet and took out a sparkling silver square plate . The green-skinned woman then opened her mouth and spat out an emerald jade slip .

Han Li also possessed a plate . It could transport exquisite objects to Deep Heaven City . After a single use, the spell plate would be destroyed .

Since Ye Ying used her own teleportation plate, Han Li didn’t need to do anything else . According to the tool refinement masters of Deep Heaven City, it was something that had been recently developed . Otherwise, if Ye Chu originally brought one, Han Li and the others wouldn’t have needed to make the journey .

Ye Ying waved her hand and struck the spell plate with a white spell seal . Suddenly, it brightly shined white .

She then tossed the spell plate in front of her and it turned into a foot-large spell formation . It spun throughout the air and began to hum .

“Let’s be quick . Although it is only a small-scale spell formation, it can alert the Wood Tribe,” Ye Ying quickly said .

Ye Chu tossed the jade slip without another thought . When it landed inside the light formation, it floated in midair .

Ye Ying then struck the plate with another spell seal .

Silver talisman characters suddenly appeared from the spell formation and it roiled . The jade slip then disappeared with a clear ring .

Soon after, the light formation vanished and the silver plate returned to normal .

However, the plate’s engravings had completely disappeared and the plate was thoroughly cracked .

Han Li felt joy and he flipped his hand to produce an azure jade talisman . He stared at it with complete attention .

It was the Myriad Distance Talisman that Deep Heaven City’s higher echelon had given him before he set off for the mission .

Ye Ying smiled when she saw this and put away the destroyed plate . Then she took out her own Myriad Distance Talisman and attentively looked at it .

Ye Chu remained expressionless and stood still .

For a time, silence filled the air .

When the time it took to finish a cup of tea had passed, Han Li’s and Ye Ying’s Myriad Distance Talismans brightly shined and they released a string of talisman characters .

Han Li’s heart fluttered as he committed each of the characters to memory .

The characters densely covered the entire jade talisman . Then, light withdrew and the jade slip turned dim once more .

At that moment, Han Li smiled .

What Deep Heaven City had sent over was clearly the method to dissolve the restriction on his bottle of Earth Cleansing Pills . It appeared the city had recognized that their mission was completed and that they were granted freedom .

Feeling ecstatic, Han Li turned his sights on Ye Ying .

When the woman stared at her Myriad Distance Talisman, her lips curled, clearly satisfied with the contents of what was displayed .

Han Li’s heart stirred .

The woman didn’t need Earth Cleansing Pills . It was unknown what the city’s higher echelons pledged to her to make her brave this danger .

The young woman finally looked through the contents of the jade talisman and she put it away . She then giggled at Han Li and said, “What? Brother Han should’ve acquired what he wanted as well . ”

“That’s right,” Han Li replied with a smile .

The young woman said with a deep tone, “In that case, let’s hurry away . Even if you have other plans, you can’t possibly want to stay in the Wood Tribe’s territory either . ”

Han Li stared at the young woman for a long while and slowly nodded .

When she saw Han Li’s answer, he felt happy and gave the green-skinned woman a command .

Ye Chu acknowledged her and released a treasure from her hand .

It was a foot-long yellow wooden bird puppet .

Ye Chu cast a spell seal and the bird rose into the air . Meanwhile, light quickly radiated from it . In the blink of an eye, it turned over forty meters wide .

It appeared vivid and true to life .

Ye Ying and Ye Chu wordlessly jumped on top of it . With some brief surprise, Han Li followed after them .

Ye Chu shouted a command and the bird’s huge wings unfolded, instantly surrounding them in a ball of yellow light as they streaked through the sky .

Ever since Han Li grouped up with the two, none of them had yet to mention their other teammates . It was as if they hadn’t existed .

When the wooden bird flew for half a day, a silver streak shot off from the horizon and flew several circles around the island where the cultivators were . It then flashed, hurrying off in the direction where the wooden bird fled .

A month later, a ball of yellow light swept across the wilderness . It was the wooden bird, carrying Han Li and the other two .

Ever since they set off, Ye Chu had been utilizing the wooden bird with her entire power . They were as fast as lightning and she had no intention of slowing down .

In this case, they were able to arrive at the entrance of the Southern Skyline in such a short amount of time .

Han Li and the two women couldn't help but feel relief .

But at that moment, storms suddenly surged in front of them and thunder roiled . The sky turned incredibly dark as dark clouds roiled around them, covering over half the sky . Faint howls could be heard past the cooming thunder .

The howls weren’t loud, but they were muffled, giving them an imposing presence . The two women’s expressions vastly changed when they heard them .

“This is . . . ” Han Li narrowed his eyes and wore hesitation on his face .

At that moment, several huge silver arcs flashed from the dark cloud and thunder rang from it . Like a huge mountaintop penetrating the clouds, two faintly golden eyes opened from the black sky . It rigidly stared at the wooden bird from a distance .

Under the darkness, Han Li sensed an icy Qi suddenly crawl up his back and instantly envelop his body . For a time, he wasn’t able to move his body in the slightest .
