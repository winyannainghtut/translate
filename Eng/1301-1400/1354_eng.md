Chapter 1354: Deep Heaven Hall

“After a war, foreign tribes usually need sixty to a hundred thousand years to launch another attack . If something unforeseen has occurred and they want to quickly start another way at the cost of their strength, it would be possible . In the great hundred tribe war five hundred years ago, foreign tribes alternated in five waves of attacks over a span of a hundred thousand years . It nearly wiped out all the strength of both humans and demons, leaving us on the verge of destruction . It took a hundred thousand years before we could flourish once more . Of course, some of these foreign tribes were exterminated during the war . ”

The large green-eyed man felt his breath turn cold and he widely opened his eyes, “The great hundred tribe war? You must be joking . That war engulfed most of the spirit realm . How can you say something like that will happen? And didn’t we end up on top after that?”

“Fellow Daoist Ma’s words are quite frightening . If another war like that happens, it will be difficult for us to survive . During that war, mortals were fine, but nine out of ten cultivators suffered heavily from them . ” Fairy Xu said with a chill .

“That’s right, that’s right, how can that . . . ”

When the others heard the words ‘Hundred Tribe War’, their faces paled as if the Daoist Priest said something fearsome, making it difficult to keep their calm .

“That’s enough . We’ve only encountered more foreign tribe scouts recently . How would that lead to another grand hundred tribe war? There is little chance of this happening . And even if it happens, it isn’t something we have control over .

Let’s first complete the patrol assignment, that’s more important . As for matters of war, let the panel of elders deal with it . ” With a calm expression, Han Li uttered his orders and took the lead .

The others promptly stopped their conversation and flew after him .

In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from the horizon .

Several days later, Han Li and the others sat on top of a Gold Court Boat and returned to a giant pagoda in Deep Heaven City .

While the others remained in the hall to rest, Han Li left the squad base alone and climbed up to the top of the stone pagoda .

After walking ten stories up, he eventually arrived at a tightly guarded gate and entered an unremarkable large hall .

The hall’s walls flickered with various restrictions . They were great in number and appeared to be incredibly powerful .

Inside the hall, apart from the stone table and a white-robed middle-aged man sitting at the side of the stone table, there was no one else .

Just as Han Li entered it, the middle-aged man slowly opened his eyes and gave Han Li a calm glance . “So it was Esteemed Nephew Han . What did you gain during this patrol? Is it living or dead? Which tribe is it?”

The middle-aged man appeared quite familiar with Han Li .

“Senior, I report that I have captured a Shadow Tribe scout alive . ” Not daring to be negligent, Han Li respectfully saluted the middle-aged man and took out a jade box and placed it on the table .

“The Shadow Tribe! Tch tch, rarely is one captured alive . Let me take a look . ” The white-robed middle-aged man’s expression stirred in excitement .

Han Li formed an incantation gesture and slapped the table in front of him .

The stone table suddenly glowed with white light and a three-meter-wide spell formation appeared with the jade box right at its center .

A layer of silver light appeared from it and the jade box was thoroughly restrained .

The middle-aged man swept his sleeve towards the jade box without any regard of the formation and opened its lid, revealing a green ball of faint light within it .

The middle-aged man examined the ball and rejoiced, “A green shadow! This is a high-grade Shadow Tribe being that is difficult to come across, and it is even alive! Nephew, this will earn you great merit!”

“Senior praises me too much! I hear that in half a month, the Deep Heaven Hall will have an Elder Xing lecture about talismans . Is this true?”

“That’s right . This time at Deep Heaven Hall, it will be Elder Xing lecturing . Although I don’t know if you follow talisman refinement, Elder Xingis famous for his talisman techniques and lecture will most likely follow that route . Could it be that Nephew Han is interested in it?” The middle-aged man said with surprise .

Han Li openly said, “I’ve recently delved into studying talismans and have gained some insights . I was hoping for some guidance . ”

The middle-aged man frowned and slowly said, “If the Dao of Talismans is studied deeply, it will have countless wondrous uses in battle, but this is only a supplementary technique . It doesn’t have much use in cultivation .

For Nephew Han to be able to progress his cultivation to mid-stage after only shortly ascending to the Spirit realm, you are a rare kind even among other ascended cultivators like us . Your exceptional talents are clear to see . But it would be best if you weren’t distracted by other things, or you may suffer harm in your main cultivation . ”

“Many thanks for your kind intentions Senior, I will take it to heart . But I do want to attend Elder Xing’s lecture . I don’t know if my accumulated merits would allow me to listen to him . ” Han Li showed no intention of backing down .

“Since you’ve made your decision, I won’t say anything further . Adding your past merits to this one, you have more than enough to enter the Deep Heaven Hall . Hehe, every ten years, an elder lectures there and you seem to never miss a single one . It should be quite tough for you as well . Alright, I’ll make a list of your accomplishments . Take it to the merit evaluation pavilion and receive your lecture token . ” He took out a jade badge from his robes and inscribed something to it before handing it over to Han Li .

Han Li took the jade badge with joy and saluted the middle-aged man . Then he bid goodbye and head into the hall .

When the middle-aged man saw Han Li leave the hall, he shook his head and then nodded . Afterwards, the jade box on the table closed and he formed an incantation gesture before pointing at the table .

The spell formation on the table glowed dazzlingly and white flashed from the box before it disappeared .

Just as the middle-aged man was teleporting the green shadow to a restricted area, Han Li flew out the Deep Heaven City market .

Several hours later, Han Li dropped down to the Profound Zenith Hall .

Han Li handed the guards a bag of spirit stones and wore the given concealment pendant before heading inside .

After walking through a long passage, Han Li emerged into the large hall . It was filled with humans and demons trading with one another .

The total of figures covered in silver and black light numbered over three hundred .

There were tens of vendors laid out all over the hall .

Han Li swept his gaze around and his gaze stopped on a stone pillar at the center of the hall .

There was a demon standing still .

Han Li took a deep breath and walked over .

Before Han Li arrived, he heard a chuckle and a sweet voice happily say, “You’ve finally come . After our last meeting, I thought you’ve secluded yourself in bitter cultivation . I thought it’d be decades before I’d see you again . ”

Han Li smiled and replied through voice transmission . “I’ve only come this time to test my luck . I didn’t think that Fellow Daoist Yan would actually arrive here . It appeared that you also sense that something had been wrong recently and also wanted to conclude our business . ”

After a pause, the woman’s voice turned ice-cold, “There is something wrong?”

“You must’ve heard about it . Take a look at the hall . There are several times more people than normal . Doesn’t this mean something?” Han Li leisurely replied . He paid no mind to the woman’s tone .

“Could it be that you’ve heard something?” A glint shined from her eyes .

“I don’t know much, but there have been high-grade cultivators dispatching troops . As for the regions we’re overseeing, more foreign tribe scouts have been appearing there . About six times as many . How are things on your side?”

After some hesitation, the woman truthfully answered, “It’s about the same . Those old fogeys have started to show their faces in greater numbers and there even are new faces in the city . Their cultivation is quite powerful . They should be new subordinates that arrived from the seven demon lands . ”

“I’ve got it . It seems there is something that’s about to happen . How often do you experience attacks from foreign tribes?” Han Li asked .

The woman sullenly answered, “Three times out of ten on a patrol . Why else has the city undergone such astonishing changes . ”

“Thirty percent, that is quite high . ” Han Li let out a long sigh and muttered to himself for a moment .

The woman indifferently said, “That’s right . After I finish this deal here, I won’t be appearing here again . If Fellow Daoist wishes to preserve his life, it’d be best for him to leave this city . Otherwise when the foreign tribes attack, it will be difficult to escape calamity considering our cultivation . ”

“Your words are quite simple, but as a cultivator of the city, how could I escape? And every year I also need . . . ” Han Li wryly laughed and his words came to a sudden stop as if something came to mind .

“Hehe, it is quite troublesome to leave the city as of current . Our races are different and I am powerless . Fortunately, even if a war breaks out, you have several years to think of a plan . Alright, that’s enough information . Let’s begin trading . ”
