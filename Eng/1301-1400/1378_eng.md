Chapter 1378: Escaping Pursuit

The four arms blurred, punching through the mist surrounding him . Two of them flashed through the phantoms, easily blocking them with dense golden palms .

Meanwhile, the other two golden arms flicked their fingers at the two wood spirits, releasing ten golden streaks of them .

The wood spirits were alarmed, but a set of azure wood armor appeared from their bodies . They also had yellow wooden shields to protect themselves .

However, the ten swordstreaks were formed from Han Li’s Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords .

In a single flash, the two wood spirits were slashed apart into several pieces .

However, Han Li didn’t stop there . Of two of the summoned arms, he flicked their palms without end . They launched a dense barrage of swordlight, instantly submerging the wood spirits in golden light .

Han Li took a deep breath and caused his struck arms to tremble . A series of golden ripples strangely appeared from them .

The two stuck arms in the wood spirit’s body and the azure spear were slowly freed after touching the golden light and trembling . The wood spirit and the spear eventually scattered into azure wood fragments and disappeared .

Han Li stretched his arms and golden light suddenly withdrew from his body . The four golden arms he summoned disappeared as well .

Using the second portion of his Provenance True Devil Arts to deal with these Nascent Soul-grade wood spirits was beyond excessive .

However, he only cultivated the technique to a shallow degree and wasn’t able to use its true abilities . He still couldn't use it to face powerful enemies and could only use it to catch them off guard .

However, once he reached Spatial Tempering-stage and cultivated the third portion of the dual cultivation technique, he was confident the Provenance True Devil Art’s power will reach an inconceivable stage . It will definitely be comparable to a top-grade technique .

With that in mind, Han Li turned into an azure streak and shot away .

Along the way, Han Li was encountered by several more waves of wood tribe beings .

However, their cultivation was mostly at Nascent Soul-stage . There were even a few that were weaker .

Han Li was able to evade these wood spirits with ease . If he couldn't, he quickly dealt with them as he couldn't afford to tangle with them for long .

However, despite his mad rush, he eventually came across a large problem half a day later .

He encountered two wood spirits with purple belts . One was tall and sturdy while the other was slender . They appeared to be a man and a woman .

Behind the two were four wood ape beasts that were twenty meters tall . They had silver fur and large yellow rods in hand .

The four wood apes had bright eyes and looked at Han Li with intelligence, giving Han Li the impression that they were dangerous . In fact, Han Li felt about the same threat from them as the two wood spirits .

These purple grade wood spirits were equivalent to Deity Transformation-stage cultivators and wouldn’t be easy to deal with .

Now that Han Li is at the edge of the Black Leaves Forest, he wanted to immediately leave and avoid any battles . However, the wood spirits and apes were looking at him with an air of hostility, and Han Li’s face turned ice cold .

Suddenly, he slapped the back of his head . A large wave of grey light suddenly soared to the sky, circling once before turning into a grey ring at least a hundred meters wide . It whirled once in the air and attracted the attention of his opponents .

Meanwhile, his other sleeve stirred as he silently summoned seventy-two small swords and sent them off in every direction .

He first planned on using the Divine Essensefused Light to occupy them . Then, the Aureate Sword Formation would exterminate them .

. . .

Meanwhile, Xiao Hong was floating in midair with a pale complexion . She was staring at several green blurs that appeared .

The three were wood spirits that wore purple belts!

. . .

Off in a different direction, Long Dong’s golden light continued to fly . A pure golden wood ape was carrying a huge black axe chasing after him . Rainbow light continued to wander around its body as it chased after him like a shooting star .

Most of the five-clawed golden dragon phantom had already dispersed . However, when he looked at the ferocious gold-furred wood ape chasing after him, he showed no intention of fighting him and continued to rush forward .

In a few hundred kilometers, he would soon arrive at the edge of the forest .

. . .

A white streak let out a piercing whistle as it tore through the air . A few kilometers behind her, a silver light closely chased after her . The two streaks intermittently flashed and they soon arrived several kilometers away .

The white streak hadn’t been able to shake off the silver light and the silver light wasn’t able to catch up to the white streak .

The two lights continued to flutter as they rushed out of the forest and into the distance .

. . .

As Han Li floated in the air, he saw the countless golden threads from the sword formation condense in a ball . Eventually, it reached the last of the silver-haired wood apes and easily tore it into pieces . He then let out a sigh and held his hands together in a spell gesture . He uttered, “Withdraw . ”

Several hundred golden lights suddenly appeared from the air and let out a clear ring . In a bright flash, they returned to their forms as seventy-two small swords .

The sword quickly spun around him and quickly shot into his sleeve .

Then with a tremble of his sleeve, the swords vanished .

At the very heart of where the sword formation used to be, there was a mist of blood that had yet to disperse .

Han Li blinked . The genuine Aureate Sword Formation formed with the seventy-two swords were far more deadly than he anticipated . In a moment of surprise, he trapped the two purple-grade wood spirits and four troublesome silver wood apes . The sword formation released golden threads that easily slew them without the slightest resistance .

When he recalled Long Dong mention Qing Yuanzi, a Spatial Tempering cultivator, was able to use a grand sword formation to block a Body Integration-stage cultivator, it appeared he was telling the truth .

With that in mind, he didn’t stay there for any longer . With the flying swords put away, he quickly headed off to the edge of the forest .

An hour later, Han Li finally arrived at the edge .

When he was fifty kilometers outside the forest, he immediately placed a High Zenith Invisibility Talisman on his body .

Suddenly, his body turned to void .

When he saw this, he let out a massive sigh of relief . Afterwards, he suddenly changed direction .

Not long after he departed, two yellow streaks arrived from behind him . Their light disappeared to reveal two wood spirits wearing yellow orange belts .

The two were the wood spirits that originally accompanied the silver-tier wood spirit . The white-robed woman had used a high-grade technique to trap them .

They circled the location where Han Li originally stopped and whispered to one another . After finally making sure there were no further tracks of Han Li, they could only resentfully return .

Han Li couldn't have known that his careful actions had allowed him to escape calamity .

Otherwise, two Spatial Tempering-grade orange belt wood spirits would’ve started pursuing him . It would’ve been impossible for him to safely escape them .

After flying for myriad more kilometers, Han Li became certain that he had escaped the wood tribe’s pursuit and he pinched his hands together . Suddenly, talisman characters flashed from his body and his body returned to normal . At that same time, a ball of spiritual light flew off from his body and turned into the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman .

He waved the talisman between two of his fingers and made it vanish .

Then, he carefully looked around him before carefully landing on a small mountain . He began to ponder with a sullen face .

At that moment, he felt rather gloomy .

The wood tribe beings destroyed the jade slip in a moment of surprise . Could it be he had failed the mission? In that case, he wouldn’t be able to acquire his needed Earth Cleansing Pills . Wouldn’t he need to return to Deep Heaven City?

No! Whoever suddenly restrained the silver-tier wood spirit was clearly the spy the humans and demons had placed in the wood tribe . In that case, the jade slip might’ve not been genuine . Perhaps information on the wood tribe is still on their body . So long as he finds this person, the mission will be complete .

With that, he suddenly sensed a glimmer of hope .

He seems he would have to find the white-robed young woman . Now, how would he find her?

Han Li’s face stirred and a strange smile appeared on his face .

His sleeve trembled and a transparent ball shot out . It circled him and turned into a palm-sized leopard .

It was the Leopard Kirin Beast .

The beast glanced at Han Li with its adorable green eyes and let out a soft purr .

Without speaking, a light flashed from his hand and he summoned an azure spell plate . He chanted a few words and he swiped the plate through the air .

Suddenly, a pea-sized white light flew out from the plate . It floated half a foot high from the plate and silently kept still .

Han Li whistled and waved his hand at the small beast .

The Leopard Kirin yawned and remained still as if it were lazy .

Han Li was dumbfounded . On the way to the wood forest, he let the beast mingle with the Weeping Soul beast for a few days . Could it be that it adopted the Weeping Soul Beast’s sleepy nature?

However, now was not the time to bother with this . He stroked his hand past his storage bracelet and took out a small green bottle . He poured out a scarlet medicine pill and tossed it at the leopard .

The lethargic leopard kirin immediately felt its spirit roused and it left an afterimage as it pounced into the air and swallowed the medicine pill . It wagged its tail as it purred and fawned over Han Li as if to get another .

Without speaking, Han Li pointed at the spell plate’s white light .

Without needing to speak, he passed over his thoughts to the beast through spiritual sense .

The small beast stirred without any further hesitation . In a moment, it strangely appeared on top of the spell plate and looked at the white dot several times . It tilted its head and then swallowed it .
