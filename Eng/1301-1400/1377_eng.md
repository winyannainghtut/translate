Chapter 1377: Appearance of Six Arms

In the wood spirit’s fright, green light flashed from their bodies as they summoned wood armor, shields, or green mist to block the crimson threads .

But the crimson threads pierced through their defenses as if they were passing through air and burrowed into their bodies .

The wood spirits glowed crimson and were then captured in a crimson net, rendered incapable of moving .

At that same moment, the sword Qi that Han Li used to chop the ancient tree had turned into two faintly golden blurs, chopping towards the silver-tier wood spirit, Mu Rui .

Mu Rui coldly snorted and pointed at them .

Two silver lights flashed as they streaked forward to meet the golden blurs .

Muffled clangs sounded and the golden blurs ruptured in countless golden specks . The specks then covered Mu Rui .

Then as the ground roared, a spell formation made of golden talisman characters suddenly lit up around Mu Rui . Its radiant glow covered the high-grade wood spirits in balls of light .

The purple light in Mu Rui’s eyes withdrew . He closed his hands together and balls of silver light appeared from his palms . Afterwards, countless silver streaks erupted .

A rumbling explosion sounded . Silver light and golden talisman characters intertwined . The golden talisman characters possessed some sort of odd ability that allowed them to block the strikes of the silver-tier wood spirit . Only a small portion of the talisman characters was dispersed .

Mu Rui felt furious at the sight of his attacks being ineffective .

Without another thought, silver light appeared from his hands and condensed balls of silver light that were even more dazzling than the last .

But at that moment, all of the wood spirits, Mu Rui included, were completely enveloped by the golden light . Although Han Li and Long Dong were astonished, they weren’t about to continue a battle to the death . They each used their own life-saving measures to immediately fly away .

Xiao Hong clutched her hands in an incantation gesture and her body sank towards the ground, instantly turning into a beautiful phoenix wrapped in black flames . She charged at the army of wood apes and turned their bodies and weapons to ash as she brushed past them .

In the blink of an eye, the phoenix traveled over three hundred meters .

Long Dong’s expression turned harsh and he swallowed a rainbow medicine pill . Soon after, he chanted an incantation and summoned a set of winged armor on his body .

The wing spread out and a golden dragon phantom appeared from the armor .

The dragon let loose a long cry and circled once around Long Dong before entering his body .

Soon after, golden light brightly shined from the blood-marked youth and he tore through the sky in a thirty-meter-long golden streak . The image of a soaring five-claw dragon could faintly be seen in the golden light . Anything that obstructed the light turned into a cloud of blood and gore .

Like their abrupt world-shaking speed, Han Li silently put his own technique into action . He unfolded a pair of azure and white wings in a clap of thunder .

He opened his mouth and spat out several crimson blood mists . They spiralled around his body before submerging his entire body in the blood mist .

The blood mist pulsed several times and shrunk, releasing a crimson streak . It blinked several times and appeared in the vast horizon, making his way past the wood ape beasts as if he were a host .

Then in another flash, Han Li’s crimson figure disappeared once more .

At Deity Transformation stage, Han Li’s Bloodshadow Evasion was several times quicker than even Long Dong’s and Xiao Hong’s movements .

When the two looked at Han Li, they couldn't help but be dumbstruck .

As for the young white-robed woman, she waved her hand and summoned a sparkling red broken blade . Without making any flashy movements, she simply waved the blade in the direction where the wood apes were the most concentrated .

All of the worldly essence Qi in the vicinity trembled and crimson blade light over three hundred meters long and leisurely traveled through the air .

The blade light inspired an uproar at the wood apes that were targetted . They all thought to flee in their terror .

But before the wood apes could flee, their bodies trembled and they combusted, instantly turning to bursts of red flame, soon turning to ash .

A clear path was now made where the apes had been .

Before the huge blade light touched anything, it had strangely disappeared .

At that moment, a fist-sized green flame bird shot out from the bottom portion of the damaged tree that hid the jade slip . It flew into the young woman’s body in a green streak .

The white-robed young woman was overjoyed when she heard this . Her body disappeared in a blur . Then she appeared in the direction of the opened passage in a flash . Then, in another blur, she reappeared at the end of the cleared passage .

Afterwards, she turned into a white streak as she tore through the air . The flight light was indistinct, but over the span of a few breaths, she already made her way past the horizon .

The speed of her flight seemed no different than Han Li’s Bloodshadow Evasion .

At that moment, Mu Rui’s silver light suddenly burst forth from the formation of golden talisman characters .

The silver light was clearly more powerful than before . In a single strike, most of the golden talisman characters had scattered with only a remaining few revolving around him .

The wood spirit’s face turned expressionless, but a purple light wildly flickered from his eyes . Suddenly, he raised his head and a series of clear screeches sounded .

At that moment, the wood ape beasts stirred and they immediately turned into several clouds, each chasing after one of the cultivators .

Meanwhile, in the distant areas of the other Black Leaves Forest, a similar screech was sounded .

Han Li hadn’t used the Bloodshadow Evasion to travel far . Once he saw no more beasts in sight, he withdrew the crimson light and continued to fly as an azure streak .

Even so, his face had still become bloodlessly pale .

It appeared that two consecutive uses of the Bloodshadow Evasion took a heavy toll on his vitality .

But when he thought of the possibility of being pursued by silver-tier wood spirits, he didn’t dare to be careless . Those wood spirits were equivalent to Body Integration-stage cultivators . Despite the confidence in his heaven-defying abilities, there was far too great a difference in their realms . He didn’t dare to hope he could win, even if it was a lower silver-tier being .

Were it not for the hidden people who assisted them and used a secret technique to restrict the silver-tier wood spirit, he feared they wouldn’t have had the opportunity to flee .

However, it was clear that the golden talisman restriction wouldn’t hold them for long . Thus, they hurriedly fled . As it was possible any of them could be pursued by the silver grade wood spirit, he didn’t dare to linger .

Although he couldn't use the Bloodshadow Evasion again, the Thunderstorm Wings on his back continued to flicker . With each flash, his speed abruptly increased . With a dozen more, his speed would be equivalent to a Spatial Tempering cultivator .

But even so, Han Li didn’t dare to turn around and focused on moving forward as quickly as he could .

Winds tore from beneath him and soon after, several gales shot towards him at immense speed .

Han Li’s expression sank and his flight came to a sudden stop .

Three azure light appeared from underneath him, each of them only a meter away from his body .

If Han Li hadn’t stopped, he feared he would’ve been skewered .

The three azure lights circled in the air and they turned into three wood tribe beings . All of them blocked his way forward .

Han Li swept his sights at the three and discovered they wore faint yellow belts at their waist and he felt relief .

They were only equivalent to Nascent Soul cultivators . He had no need to worry .

Unwilling to use his various treasures, he simply flapped his wings and he shot forward in azure-white lightning .

The speed of lightning was instantaneous . He arrived in front of the center wood spirit in a blur .

The wood spirit didn’t show any emotion, but purple light quickly circled from its eyes . Then, it fearlessly stabbed its wood spear into Han Li’s abdomen .

Before the spear touched him, countless azure thorns ruptured from it, wanting to turn Han Li into a pincushion .

Han Li’s eyes godly glinted and golden light flashed from his hands, instantly covering his body in transparent golden scales . The azure thorns clanged and bounced off upon impact, leaving no damage .

Then, his arms strangely reached out and grabbed the tip spear . The wood spirit tried to pull it back with all its might, but the spear didn’t move in the slightest .

Azure Qi lit up from the wood spirit’s face and then it released the spear, quickly fleeing back like a shooting star .

However, Han Li’s other hand suddenly burst forward as sharp cracks sounded from it . It instantly arrived at the wood spirit’s chest and sank his fingers through like a sword .

A clear ring sounded . The wood spirit’s body was torn like paper by Han Li’s powerful strength . Then, he tore out a faint yellow crystal from the wood spirit’s body .

This entire attack only took a single instant .

When the other two wood spirits saw this, they let out a strange screech . They spat out a yellow mist and waved their spears, creating countless phantoms to surround Han Li .

Han Li sneered and twisted his arms, wanting to use them to battle .

But something outside his expectations occurred .

With one hand in the wood spirit’s body and the other grasping the spear, green light brightly shined from the wood spirit’s body and he feels an inconceivable attractive force .

His hands blurred, and soon, he found he couldn't move them in the slightest .

In that slight delay, yellow mist instantly covered his face and countless phantoms released azure streaks at him .

Han Li’s face strangely twisted and his lips moved as if he were about to say something .

Suddenly, golden light brightly shined from his body . Four indistinct golden arms suddenly appeared through the ribs of a few of the phantoms .
