Chapter 1318: Zhao Wugui

“What? Could it be that this place has sacred areas with dense spirit Qi?” Han Li asked with roused spirits .

“Hehe, there are several of these cultivation sites throughout the city . But we only have one that is equivalent to those found in the three sovereign’s main cities . But what is important is that not only do we have a stream of materials from the lands of humans and demons, but the city is also the sole entrance between those lands and the wilderness . As a result, there are countless rare treasures that are brought back from the wilderness . A vast majority of cultivators sell or exchange these materials . Even medicines that allow for advancement over a single night are on the market . However, their price makes them something that could only be looked at . ”

The old man briefly paused before adding, “There is also another reason why the cultivators of this city aren’t willing to leave it . Every ten years, the Deep Heaven City cultivators listen to someone from the council of elders explain the worldly Dao . It can answer some doubts about cultivation . And all of the elders are at Integration stage cultivation . Nobody else has the same opportunities we do . Hehe, that is why those that join the city don’t often wish to leave . ”

“Those benefits!” Han Li felt joy at the explanation, but he soon frowned and asked, “But why are there so many high-grade cultivators guarding the city?”

“In addition to human cultivators, there are also large quantities of demon cultivators that guard the city . They occupy the other half of the city . And apart from that, there are large quantities of demon beasts and body refiners . Half of those low-grade existences originated from the city, while the other half comes from the outside . Our council of elders consists of over ten Integration-stage cultivators . With such astonishing might, the city has naturally become a target of the wilderness’ outer tribes and true spirit level existences . The elders have arranged and extremely powerful and profound Immortal formation forcing successive generations of outer invasions to first go through the city . If so much power wasn’t garrisoned here, the outer tribes would exterminate us . I heard that if we were to truly fight with the outer tribes, most of the city would be eradicated . ” Old Man Liu wore a solemn expression .

When Han Li heard this, his expression faintly changed . “More than half eradicated?”

“There is no need for Brother Han to be so worried . An outer tribe invades us once anywhere from sixty thousand years at the earliest, to a hundred thousand years at the latest . Against such a long period, there is no need for you to be worried . If there is truly an invasion, then you’d be out of luck and could only fight to the death . As for anybody that flees that Deep Heaven City’s guard, they will be jointly pursued by both demons and humans . Since there is a smooth life in the city, it is natural to have a bit of danger with it . However, the last invasion of Deep Heaven City took place thirty thousand years ago . We will have another twenty thousand years before we have to worry about anything .

“So it was like that . In that case, I was brought here to Deep Heaven City so I could be profited from . ” Han Li stroked his chin with a pensive expression .

“Of course . Initial generation ascended have far higher odds of entering Spatial Tempering than natives and descendants like me . Each ascended cultivator is viewed with great importance by the elders and aren’t easily let go . Furthermore, over the past few years, there have been fewer ascended cultivators appearing at the Spirit Flight Tower . I heard several of the elders send spiritual sense threads down to the lower realms to investigate the matter, but they hadn’t succeeded . Since Brother Han came from a lower realm, did you notice anything strange?”

When Han Li heard this, he suddenly recalled the matter with the Elder Devil and felt his heart tremble, but he maintained a normal expression and answered, “Nothing . My world was quite normal . ”

“That is a pity . If Brother Han was able to come up with a reason, he would be heavily rewarded . However, of the cultivators that ascended recently, they also had no clues . I only heard in recent years that the demon clans discovered something . As a result, the elder council shouldn’t interrogate you much over the matter . ”

Han Li smiled and then asked, “Ah yes, Brother Liu mentioned something about the Dark Azure Guards . Could you tell me something about them? Are they the ones I saw wearing azure armor?”

“That’s right . Dark Azure Guards are a mid-grade existence in our city, and I am one of them . They command ten black-armored guards . Dark Azure Guards require Deity Transformation-stage cultivation, but not all Deity Transformation-stage cultivators are Dark Azure Guards . Brother Han should realize the difference . ”

“I have an idea . They either lack leadership or aren’t skilled in battle, I think . ”

“That is correct . Now that we’re on the topic, there are two types of Deep Heaven City guards . There are those that appointed missions on a fixed schedule and may make arrangements for themselves during other times . But these guards aren’t given many spirit stones during their ten-year tenure and are often found wanting more, but there is very little danger .

The other kind undergo missions that are assigned by the council of elders . Each finished mission will give good benefits . Not only spirit stones but treasures, medicine, and other treasures are rewarded . Of course, these missions are far more dangerous, and most often relate to outer tribes in the wilderness . One must make careful consideration before agreeing . However, after each completed mission you don’t need to take another assignment anywhere from decades to a century . You’ll be able to peacefully cultivate for longer periods of time . Of course, the two posts aren’t rigid and you can change your posts as you wish . ”

“Many thanks for Brother Liu’s pointers . ” Han Li said with a calm expression .

The old man chuckled and waved his hand . Then they chatted for a while more before the old man stood up and departed .

After the old man left, Han Li’s smile faded and he walked into the secluded room and medicated in silence .

As for the dark-skinned old man, he returned to where the other Deity Transformation cultivators were chatting .

When they saw the old man, they all walked over to him .

“Did Brother Lu acquire any information from him?”

“Information? That man is tight-lipped . Apart from acknowledging he is someone who ascended from a lower realm, he said nothing else . I only answered a few of his questions . ” The old man shook his head with a helpless expression .

“Hehe, it is only natural for him to be cautious when Brother Liu came knocking on his door . He only just arrived in the spirit realm . However, we don’t have any intentions other than befriend him . After all, the ascended have high potential . . . ”

The Deity Transformation-stage cultivators continued to chat pleasantly as if they had no evil intentions towards Han Li . As for Old Man Liu, he simply smiled in silence .

On the morning of the next day, Han Li sat motionlessly in the secluded room before suddenly opening his eyes .

He then walked out into the living room and used his command medallion to open the main door .

There was a white-clothed cultivator standing there with a blank expression .

“Greetings Senior!” Han Li didn’t dare to neglect him and saluted him with both hands .

This was the pale-faced man in golden armor from before, but now he exchanged the armor for Confucian robes . The harsh aura from his body had eased and he gave a more humble impression .

“Fellow Daoist Han, there is no need to be so polite . I’ve only just arrived . Since Brother Li is busy with other matters, I will be the only one to see you today . My name is Zhao Wugui . ” The Spatial Tempering cultivator appeared to be far friendlier than the day before .

Surprised, Han Li hastily addressed him as “Senior Zhao . ” He then invited him into the room and gave him the main seat in the living room .

As soon as Zhao Wugui took a seat, he offered Han Li an azure jade pendant, “Since you’ve been here for half a day, you must have questions . I’ll keep the long story short . As an ascended cultivator and someone who was able to persist against two-colored tribulation for so long, you must possess powerful abilities . As such, I’ve already had you apply for the position of a Dark Azure Guard . This is your identity token . Keep it well . When the time comes, you’ll take over third squad fifty-six . They are the small group of four you saw at the teleportation hall the day before . ”

Han Li didn’t immediately reach out for it and hesitantly said, “As someone who's just arrived, there is much I don’t understand . Isn’t it a bit rash for me to suddenly be appointed to that position?”

Zhao Wugui chuckled, “Fellow Daoist Han doesn’t need to be so modest . Every ascended cultivator is appointed a Deep Azure Guard when they come to the city . They are mostly all extremely competent . As for your understanding of the city, you will know everything about it after living here for a year . ”

Han Li’s eye stirred and he eventually took the jade pendant . “In that case, I won’t decline it . ”

Under close examination, he noticed silver rune patterns inscribed on it . It also had the golden characters “third squad fifty-six”

When Han Li took the jade pendant, Zhao Wugui nodded with satisfaction . Afterwards, he began to explain some of the general knowledge regarding the city . Some of it had been mentioned by Old Man Liu the day before, and some of it was new . It was very useful, of course .

Zhao Wugui took out a white jade slip from his storage pouch and handed it over to Han Li, “Alright, I’ve said enough . This is only a place where ascended cultivators are kept temporarily . It isn’t appropriate for long term use . All cultivators at Nascent Soul-stage and above are given their own residence in Deep Heaven City . However, you’ll have to strive for the better ones . You know more when you make arrangements at the Jade Fault Pavilion . This is a map of the city . Take a good look at it . For the first month you come to the city, there is no need for you to immediately take an assignment . But in a month, you will be assigned a set of Deep Azure Armor . ” Then he bid farewell .

Han Li respectfully thanked him and walked him out .
