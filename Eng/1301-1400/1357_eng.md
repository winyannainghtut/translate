Chapter 1357: Spirit Insects Completion

When the cultivators heard the two Spatial Tempering stage cultivators speak, they all felt a chill run down their bodies and their faces all changed .

A coin flip for death . This assignment was just too dangerous, but it was only a likely possibility for the foreign tribes to invade . And if it were only an attack by a single tribe, they were confident they would survive .

When that came to mind, the assignment seemed far more dangerous .

Of course, a decision regarding one’s own life couldn't be considered simple . They needed to put much consideration over it .

For a time, silence filled the hall .

Cultivator Wen added, “Fellow Daoists, don’t need to immediately make a decision . These assignments will continue to be issued for a year . Furthermore, so long as you take the assignment, we’ll find someone to take over your original office in the guard . Don’t worry if you’re on regular assignments . ”

Han Li raised his head and said, “Senior Wen, even if we finish that assignment, how will the matter of the Earth Cleansing Pill be resolved . Even if we complete the mission, we’ll perish to two-colored tribulation . ”

Zhao Wugui replied, “So it is Nephew Han . You don’t need to worry about that . These dangerous missions were meant to be putting everything at stake . Naturally, we will give you all the Earth Cleansing Pills you need, but they will be placed under a restriction .

If you don’t truly attend to your mission, these Earth Cleansing Pills destroy themselves, so do not abandon your mission . You should understand the consequences . ”

“So it was like that . Thanks for the explanation, Senior . ” Han Li nodded and calmly sat down .

When several people in the room heard this, their faces remained unchanged, but they wryly smiled in their minds .

The last of their hopes were annihilated .

“We’ve already mentioned this all to you . The first wave of missions will be issued in half a month . If you do plan on taking the assignment, it will be best to prepare . Although Elder Lei Luo chose those assignments for you all in particular, if there are other cultivators that take them, nothing can be done about it .

The meeting is now over . Everyone, return and think well about your choice . ” With that said, Cultivator Wen ended the meeting with a smile .

He then stood up with Zhao Wugui and they took the first steps out of the hall .

The other cultivators remained still for a moment before heading out as well . Most of them frowned as if heavy thoughts weighed on their minds .

Han Li wasn’t in a hurry to leave . Instead, he remained in his seat as his mind wandered .

A short moment later, there were sparsely few in the hall .

“Oh? Is Brother Han tempted to take the assignment?” One person walked up and asked Han Li with a friendly face .

Han Li’s expression stirred and he looked at the person who approached him . He beamed and answered, “So it was Fairy Xuan . I am somewhat tempted . The Seniors arranged this choice so it was a method of self-preservation . It is only a bit too dangerous . ”

The woman in azure palace robes who approached Han Li was a mid Deity Transformation cultivator .

Han Li had seen her several times during the meeting and had spoken to her before . They could be considered acquaintances .

Cultivator Xuan sweetly smiled and said, “I heard on a patrol mission not long before, Brother Han captured a green shadow all by himself . It appears Brother Han’s abilities are beyond a late-Deity Transformation cultivator . If Fellow Daoist takes this mission, you should be better off than most Fellow Daoists . How about we join hands and take on the mission together?”

Although an azure scarf covered her face, from her exposed skin and enchanting eyes, she was clearly a woman of outstanding beauty .

Han Li felt some surprise at her proposal . After staring at her face, he slowly shook his head . “You overpraise me . It hasn’t been long since I’ve entered mid-stage . I can’t be compared to you . As for taking on the assignment, I still haven’t made a decision . It is still too soon . ” Han LI’s words were polite, but they carried a tactful rejection .

Cultivator Xuan betrayed some disappointment from her eyes, but she didn’t continue to pursue the topic . After chatting with him for a bit, she took her leave .

Once Han Li watched her leave, he withdrew his gaze and sank into thought .

Although the woman’s cultivation wasn’t weak and she cultivated the Three Thousand Jade technique that was said to be formidable, he has always acted alone . He didn’t want an outsider to know about the treasures he carried .

Even if he took on the mission, he had no intention to team up with anyone . Furthermore, there was an important matter that kept him near the city . Even if the war started tomorrow, he wouldn’t be able to immediately leave .

The myriads of Gold Devouring Beetles that he fostered with Rainbow Skirt Grass had finally fulfilled their requirements for maturation a year before . With the maturation technique he acquired from the Endless Sky Saintess, they’re finally done .

In several months to a year, the insects will finish their transformation and will become completely mature . How could he depart during a crucial moment of their change? It could result in the failure of their advancement .

As Han Li felt some anxiousness, he eventually took a breath and departed .

He flew up in an azure streak and headed back to the city .

A dozen days later, Deep Heaven Hall would have a lecture, something he wouldn’t want to miss .

As such, after he returned to the stone pagoda housing his squad, he immediately sealed himself inside a seclusion room and sat cross-legged on a mat .

Han Li flipped his hand to produce a yellow bottle and tossed out a thumb-sized azure pill before swallowing it .

A layer of faint azure light then lit off from his body .

A glint flashed through Han Li’s eyes and he reached out with his hand . His spread out his fingers and slowly shut his eyes .

A light pop sounded . A spiritual light flashed from the top of Han Li’s head and a two-inch large Nascent Soul appeared from his head .

The Nascent Soul stood on top of a small cauldron . Dozens of miniature golden swords were flying around him . It had an imposing appearance .

The Nascent Soul lowered its head to look at the body beneath it and it closed its hand together . It blinked and its eyes separately turned black and white before wearing an innocent smile .

It opened its mouth and spat out a silver fireball that struck the top of its palm . With a light bang, the silver flames enveloped the palm .

A strange scene followed .

Black light flashed from the seemingly ordinary palm and the five fingers released five bone rings . Every bone ring had a vividly detailed skull engraved on it .

These skulls twisted their appearances inside the silver flames as if they were alive . They had had differing expressions, ranging from happiness, pain, to nothing at all .

Regardless of their appearance, the ring’s shapes continued to fluctuate inside the silver flames . What was even more outrageous was his palm was changing alongside the rings . Furthermore, its flesh had become more crystalline and white as if it were more jade than flesh .

The Nascent Soul tilted its head and opened its mouth to release a fireball, striking the body’s other palm .

Silver light brightly flashed and the bewitching flame completely wrapped the hand .

What was most incredible was that the palm changed under the effects of the silver flame . It turned pitch-black and began to char from the heat . A small mountain design appeared from his palm and the back of his hand simultaneously . Grey slightly faintly pulsed from them .

As this strange scene occurred from both these palms, the silver flames and the Nascent Soul blurred, disappearing back into the crown of Han Li’s head .

Meanwhile, an azure light lit up from Han Li’s body and turned faintly golden . A golden phantom appeared from behind him .

Although the silhouette was vague, it appeared to possess three heads and six arms .

Han Li’s naked wrist and cheek had squares of pure gold talisman characters that slowly roamed across his flesh . From a distance, they looked like golden scales .

With golden light radiating from Han Li’s body, he looked nearly divine .

. . .

A dozen days later, Han Li emerged from seclusion with a calm expression . After attending the lecture of Deep Heaven Hall for three entire days, Han Li walked out from the city and returned to his cave residence .

In addition, a month after Han Li returned to his cave residence, Deep Heaven City’s panel of elders suddenly released a set of extremely dangerous and rewarding missions . These missions were related to various foreign clans but most of them required Deity Transformation-grade cultivation .

This aroused commotion in the city .

But because these missions were extremely dangerous, very few accepted them .

During this time, several uninvited guests arrived in Han Li’s spirit land and paid him a visit .

Inside his cave residence, these people had a probing chat with him for half a day before quietly departing . This led Han Li with a wavering expression . After spending several days in deep thought in his seclusion room, he finally came to a decision .

Four months later, most of his Gold Devouring Beetles have reached complete maturation, resulting in seven thousand formidable spirit insects .

Han Li promptly collected them and headed to a secret area in Deep Heaven City where the secret missions were being assigned and quietly vanished .

Not long after, Han Li’s small squad received an order and had their leader replaced with another Deity Transformation cultivator .

It wasn’t rare for cultivators like Han Li to mysteriously disappear . Since he was an ascended cultivator, he was likely to be unaffiliated or a secret disciple of a noble clan .

The sole trait of these people was that they were all Deity Transformation-stage cultivators . In addition, they were all particularly outstanding individuals .
