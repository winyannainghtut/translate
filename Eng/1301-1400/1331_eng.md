Chapter 1331: Giant Beast and an Eccentric

The Floating Dawn Swamp was worthy of its ominous reputation .

For some unknown reason, when they entered the swamp, Han Li’s spiritual sense couldn't spread past three hundred meters away . There wasn’t much one could do to protect themselves from the illusory fog .

But what was most troublesome was the strange ‘Sharp Worms” lurking in the dripping sludge .

These worms had centipede-like limbs and body, but countless slender sharp mouths lined its body, all capable of spitting venom that can corrode magic treasures and devour a cultivator’s protective light .

If it were only one or two, they wouldn’t have caught their attention, but these types traveled in groups . Ever since they entered the swamp sludge, tens of worms would simultaneously emerge, all of them about three-meters-long and capable of flight .

Naturally, each time a group of them were disturbed, the squad would scramble to respond .

If they weren’t given a patrol assignment, they would’ve simply flown over the swamp so they didn’t have to deal with the sharp worms .

As a patrol squad, they needed to examine traces of foreign tribes which was impossible to do if they flew high in the air . They were only able to fly at low altitudes .

As such, worm attacks became commonplace but there wasn’t anything that could be done to prevent them .

There was even one time when they disturbed a huge number of worms, provoking over four hundred worms from the swamp .

If it weren’t for Han Li’s Divine Essensefused Light, they would’ve swarmed the squad and inflict heavy losses . Instead, the light suspended the worms in midair where they were incinerated by spirit fire .

Initially, they had doubts about Han Li’s abilities since they hadn’t seen him use them prior, but now, they felt far more at ease .

Of course, the Floating Dawn Swamp had other dangers than just the worms .

There were the ancient Silverhead Beasts that were fond of concealing themselves in the dense jungle . They were able to separate their heads from their body and have their various body parts split, launching different attacks . Han Li found them difficult to deal with .

Fortunately, the beasts’ movements were slow and the area was difficult to traverse . So long as the squad flew out of their range, the beasts couldn't pursue them .

As such, they weren’t nearly as dangerous as the sharp worms .

But soon, Han Li and the others came to have a deep understanding as to why the Floating Dawn Swamp was the named the grade one patrolled area .

They had to maintain a heightened level of vigilance nearly the whole time . If they weren’t careful, they could suffer injury .

Under these circumstances, two weeks passed in the blink of an eye . The squad maintained their vigilance, but they didn’t discover any traces of foreign tribes, much to the relief of those in the squad .

The tense atmosphere in the squad eventually eased up .

One day, a group of cultivators in the squad were holding the Foreign Spirit plates in their hand while flying for most of the day . Even high-grade cultivators couldn't help but tire from this . After all, one needed to remain vigilant on patrol and would cause much strain on their mind .

At that moment, they arrived in front of a clear pond three hundred meters wide . There was a small pile of rocks at the pond side with a row of slender green bamboo growing from it . It was a refreshing scene one would find in a painting .

Their spirits were roused .

The large green-eyed man exchanged a glance with the others and he drew close to Han Li . He respectfully said, “Senior Han, this place seems quite good . How about we rest for a moment before we continue the patrol . ”

“That’s fine, but be careful . First, take a look if there is anything strange,” Han Li calmly said .

On their assignment, Han Li rarely gave orders and was welcoming of the squad’s proposals .

This caused the distance between Han Li and the squad to unconsciously become closer .

“Of course!” The green-eyed man said with a smile . He then waved to the others behind him .

Two old men and the pair of women spread out quickly flying in the circle . With no reaction from the Foreign Spirit Plate, they landed next to the scattered rocks near the pond with relief .

They couldn't stay too long, so they simply found a clean area for themselves to sit and rest .

As a Deity Transformation cultivator and someone who cultivated the Great Development Arts, the patrol hadn’t taken much strain on his mind . He hadn’t joined them as a result, and simply took a leisurely stroll around the pond as he glanced around .

The pond wasn’t very deep, but its water was very clear .

Inside the water swam a finger-sized silver fish that appeared harmless .

Han Li frowned when he saw this and unconsciously raised his head and turned to look at the dozen stalks of bamboo .

A few winds seemed to be blowing nearby, but they didn’t cause much sound, adding to the serene atmosphere .

The squad cultivators were sitting either at the edge of the water or next to the bamboo forest, all still .

Han Li then turned his glance at the mirror-like surface of the water and muttered to himself for a moment . His eyes became narrow for just a moment . He slowly turned around and lifted his leg in the direction of the bamboo forest .

But in that brief instant, Han Li flicked his fingers hidden inside his sleeves . Red lights flashed and ten red lines sank into the ground .

This all occurred silently and without a trace .

When Han Li slowly walked towards the bamboo forest, he stopped in front of it and looked at it with a calm gaze .

This action seemed somewhat bizarre .

The youth surnamed Yin and the woman surnamed Xu couldn't help but open their eyes when they detected this strange action and gave each other a strange glance .

However, Han Li ignored them and his gaze soon became ice cold . He opened his mouth . A golden light shot out and chopped through the green forest in a crack of lightning .

Then with a crack, a bowl-thick stalk of green bamboo was split through the middle .

“Yi!” The youth surnamed Yin yelped in shock .

Fairy Xu also looked with wide eyes .

But before they could process what happened, an incomprehensible scene occurred .

A fountain of dark green liquid spouted from the opening of the split bamboo, spreading an incredibly fishy smell in the air .

What was even more astonishing was how the earth rumbled at nearly the same time . A painful roar shook the ground and the green bamboo trembled, turning into thick hair-like tentacles and fiercely striking at Han Li .

As if he could allow such a simple attack to hit him . He disappeared in a blur and appeared above the water, coldly looking down at dancing tentacles that attacked him .

The cultivators that were resting nearby were startled by this sudden change and soared into the air in panic . They even released several of their bladed weapons to strike the tentacles .

When they saw that Han Li chopped off one of the tentacles, they unconsciously took the action lightly .

However, they wholly didn’t expect for the tentacle to give a strange metallic clang upon impact, easily repelling the weapons .

In the astonishment of the other cultivators, they also thought to attack when the grey stones at the side of the pond suddenly turned black . The scattered stones twisted together to form skull-sized black scales . They belonged to a huge ancient beast .

The beast appeared round, but one wasn’t able to see its nose or mouth . However, there were thin tentacles on its back that were over thirty-meters long . It seemed to be lying hidden next to the pond . The bamboo was a transformation of its flesh .

Cultivators seemed to have been resting on the surface of the beast . It had used some sort of unknown ability to conceal itself not only from their spiritual sense but also from their Foreign Spirit Plate .

“Attack!” Han Li shouted from the air .

The cultivators felt their hearts trembled and they immediately released their treasures . For a time, various-colored light shined in the air and engulfed the huge beast in a torrent .

The ancient beast had no intention to flee . Rather, the tentacles on its back hurriedly danced, turning into a grey blurs of light, blocking the attacks on its body .

Whenever a tentacle blocked an attack, a rumbling explosion sounded and it fiercely blocked the magic treasure . Regardless of where the treasure struck, they were bluntly repelled, preventing any attack from striking at its true body .

The youth surnamed Ying coldly snorted, clapped his hands together, and raised them . A ball of red and yellow light appeared in each hand, suddenly releasing a hail of fist-sized lightning fireballs upon the beast’s face . As for Fairy Xu, a cold silver light glowed from her body and wildly flashed, producing countless ice-attributed balls of lightning .

The two types of lightning flames seemed to merge and created astonishing momentum . A deafening boom resulted, creating blinding lightning, completely enveloping most of the beast .

When the others saw this, they couldn't help but smile .

At that moment, Han Li had yet to take action and was merely observing his subordinates’ attacks .

“Hmph!” A bone-chilling snort sounded from the direction of the lightning fireballs .

An otherworldly wind suddenly blew from underneath them .

The wind was hazy and shook, circling itself a few times before stirring up a tornado . It completely swept up the lightning fireballs .

A series of explosions could be heard within the tornado, resulting in both the tornado and lightning flames disappearing .

Youth Ying and Fairy Xu were both greatly alarmed . The others also appeared deeply shocked .

A strange person appeared on top of the huge beast .

The person had green flesh of some unknown hide . It had no clothes, a bald head, and nostrils, but its eyes lacked any emotion .

But what was more strange was that the legs underneath his thighs merged with the huge beast as if they were one and the same .
