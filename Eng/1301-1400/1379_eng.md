Chapter 1379: Wood Phoenix

The Leopard Kirin Beast shut its green eyes for a while before opening them again . It then let out a soft growl .

Han Li smiled .

Ever since he acquired the small beast, he discovered in addition to its quick speed and durable body, it also had extraordinary tracking abilities .

So long as the beast sensed something, no matter if the target was alive, dead, or behind a myriad of restrictions, it could find the item accurately .

This kind of tracking doesn’t merely use the physical senses; it was an inconceivable ability related to spiritual sense .

At the very least, the beast was able to track Han Li down while he used the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman and stood still .

As for the spell plate and the speck of white light, it was obviously linked to the young white-robed woman . He also had a speck of pure spiritual Qi for the other cultivators as well .

The small beast looked all around and tilted its head as if in thought . Soon, it stirred and shot off into a faint yellow blur .

Han Li didn’t immediately chase after it . Instead, he formed an incantation gesture and suddenly struck an azure light at the ground .

As a result, a faint ring sounded from the ground . A ball of silver flame suddenly burst from the ground . A faint flame raven fluttered around it .

Originally inside Black Leaves Forest, he had concealed a Spirit Engulfing Flame raven in the ground .

For the sake of carefulness, when Han Li escaped, he hadn’t taken back the flame . Fortunately, the flame was already completely refined . Even at the speed he was traveling, he was still able to command it to follow him .

Of course, the flame raven wasn’t a true spirit beast . It needed to use a bit of magic power to maintain its shape . However, it was such a little amount to his current cultivation that he didn’t mind .

When he saw there was no problem with his flame raven, Han Li nodded . Then he pointed and the bird disappeared into the ground .

It was still quite dangerous there . He may as well keep it prepared just in case .

With that done, Han Li summoned light around himself and flew off in an azure streak . With a few blinks, he quickly chased after the Leopard Kirin Beast .

The small beast was heading north . After a long while, it eventually changed direction .

Han Li was startled, but he kept silent and changed direction with it .

Afterwards, the Leopard Kirin Beast changed directions several more times .

This caused Han Li’s face to turn solemn .

This illustrated that the white-robed woman, Ye Ying, was continuously shifting movements, likely because she was still being pursued . She wouldn’t have sharply changed direction so many times if this were not the case .

However, this wouldn’t stop him .

With his current abilities, so long as he wasn’t heavily surrounded or faced an opponent with vastly superior cultivation, he was confident he’d be able to preserve his life .

As he needed this woman to acquire his Earth Cleansing Pills, he couldn't leave her alone .

Expressionless, Han Li closely followed the Leopard Kirin and chased after it like azure lightning .

The chase continued for three entire days, but Han Li had yet to catch sight of her .

But on the morning of the fourth day, he arrived at the edge of vast blue waters with no end in sight . The Leopard Kirin Beast suddenly stopped .

With roused spirits, Han Li arrived at the beast’s side in a flash of azure light .

The beast turned its raggy head and softly whimpered as if it were trying to say something .

If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t be able to understand, but Han Li happily said, “You mean they aren’t far away? We’ve arrived? You can have this . Go ahead and return . ”

Han Li flicked his finger and tossed another scarlet medicine pill .

The small beast blurred with delight and caught the medicine pill in midair . It spat out a white speck of light and flew back into Han Li’s sleeve in a chain of afterimages .

Han Li flipped his hand and took out a spell plate, absorbing back the white speck . Then, light flashed from his hand and he summoned a High Zenith Invisibility Talisman .

When Han Li saw its dim light, he frowned and hesitated . He then summoned an identical talisman with a flip of his hand .

However, the purple talisman he produced was brimming with dazzling light .

For his trip into the wilderness, he spent great effort to refine an additional two High Zenith Invisibility Talismans .

He had already spent most of the power of the first talisman . For the sake of carefulness in the face of unknown danger, Han Li had best used the fresh talisman .

After putting away the dim talisman, his new talisman blurred and silver characters flashed . His body disappeared .

Soon after, he formed an incantation gesture and his body blurred . He easily flew in the direction that the Leopard Kirin pointed at .

It was unknown if the water belonged to a huge lake, or if it were the edge of a sea . After he flew for over six hundred kilometers, he didn’t spot any land . He did eventually come across a small unremarkable island .

The island was five kilometers long and was dense with vegetation . It appeared to be entirely uninhabited .

Han Li glanced at the island and then raised his head, looking around . He quietly flew towards the center of the island .

According to what the Leopard Kirin said, it should be the island .

There was a small basin at the heart of the island with a few grey-white stones stacked on top of one another .

A white-robed young woman with a pale complexion sat on a huge stone cross-legged . There was a wood tribe woman respectfully standing at attention in front of her .

When Han Li saw this, he was alarmed and he came to a sudden stop . He examined the unfamiliar woman with narrow eyes .

The woman’s flesh was exactly the same as a common wood spirit, a shallow green . Also, she wore an orange-yellow belt, revealing herself to be a tree spirit at Spatial Tempering stage . But under closer examination, Han Li discovered the woman appeared much different compared to an ordinary wood spirit .

When the tree spirit faced the white-robed woman, she wore a dignified and respectful expression different from the wooden expressions of other wood spirits . Furthermore, Han Li was able to sense a vastly powerful fire spiritual power from the woman’s body, despite not releasing his spiritual sense . Only pure wood spiritual Qi should be present in a wood tribe being .

This person wasn’t a wood spirit!

Han Li quickly came to this conclusion . Afterwards, he looked at the young woman .

He discovered in addition to the young woman’s deathly pale complexion, there was a fist-sized bloodstain on the young woman’s chest . It was as if a blood flower had blossomed, a clear indication of a wound .

When he saw this, Han Li hesitated, considering whether he should reveal himself .

At that moment, the young woman raised her head and smiled at him . “Brother Han, since you’re here, how about you join me and rest?”

Han Li felt deeply shocked when he heard this .

How was it possible for her to see through his invisibility .

The High Zenith Invisibility Talisman might not be effective against Body Integration-stage cultivators, but it could definitely hide him from Spatial Tempering-stage individuals . Could it be the woman was pretending? But the woman smiled in his direction, clearly showing his position .

The only explanation he could think of was that she had a spiritual sense equivalent to a Body Integration cultivator .

Han Li felt bewildered . After some thought, silver talisman characters flickered from his body and his body slowly came into view .

Soon after, he slapped his body and summoned a purple talisman into the air and then his hand .

With a calm appearance, Han Li descended to the ground . “Fellow Daoist Ye, who is this Fellow Daoist? Could you introduce me to her?”

“Sure . This is the spy that the humans and demons placed in the wood tribe, Fellow Daoist Ye Chu . It appears Fellow Daoist had escaped the wood tribe’s pursuit . ” The young woman said with a smile . She then examined Han Li with a smile . When she saw that Han Li was in good health, she couldn't help but betray her surprise .

“Ye Chu? Is she a human or a demon?” Han Li glanced at the green-skinned woman and narrowed his eyes .

The woman calmly glanced at Han Li and said, “Your eyes are quite sharp . I am a human, but my body possesses Wood Phoenix Spirit Blood . I can be considered half-demon . ” Her voice was somewhat hoarse .

“A Wood Phoenix? Yi! You have Spatial Tempering cultivation!” When he heard her name, he swept his spiritual sense past her and his face changed .

Ye Ying answered with bright eyes, “Older Sister Chu comes from our Ye Clan . She possessed early Spatial Tempering cultivation when she was sent to spy on the wood tribe . After many years had passed, she has completed the cycle of Spatial Tempering and is bordering the Body Integration stage . ”

“This is thanks to a few benefits I acquired from the wood tribe, or else I wouldn’t have reached this stage . However, I didn’t expect that the young master would personally come here . ” Ye Chu spoke with a modest tone and stood in front of the young woman with a helpless appearance .

Han Li felt a chill facing a person with such fearsome cultivation . With a respectful expression, he said, “So it was like that . If Senior hadn’t come to rescue us, I fear we would’ve been completely wiped out . ”

“Let’s get to that later . ” Ye Ying’s smile faded and her face turned serious, “Because I was chased too quickly, I have yet to ask what happened . Older Sister Chu, why did we fall into the wood tribe’s trap . Where are the others?”

The green-skinned woman answered, “Apart from me, all the others were killed . About a hundred years before, the wood tribe acquired information on our spies . It was only because of my Wood Phoenix blood that I was able to escape detection . The others were caught and tried to escape, but they were caught one by one . ”
