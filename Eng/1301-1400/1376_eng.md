Chapter 1376: The Wood Tribe

From a distance, the hill looked ordinary as if there were no changes to it at all, but it was actually just an illusion .

Han Li was standing on the hill, right in front of the half-charred ancient tree .

When Han Li looked at it, he recalled what Long Dong and Xiao Hong had mentioned .

According to what they said, if it was possible, they could meet a spy planted by the humans and demons and receive information that was difficult to record . But if it was too dangerous, and they personally couldn't make the trip, the spy could be disregarded .

Now that he swept his spiritual sense past the area, it appeared that no one had come .

In this case, the assignment was actually quite simple . So long as he removes the item, the mission will be considered complete for him .

With that decided, Han Li extended his finger and swiped it at the ancient tree .

A crackle sounded and an azure sword streak shot forward, cleaving the tree into two .

It contained a white jade slip there .

Han Li’s face lit up with joy and he reached out for it, summoning it into his hand .

At that moment, a muffled sound traveled through the air . A golden light suddenly pierced through the illusion, directly shooting towards the jade slip .

Han Li’s face slightly changed . Without another thought, azure light flashed from his hand . A hand of azure light appeared in the air and swiped at the golden light .

A sweet giggle sound from the golden light . It broke through the azure hand like it was an illusion . The jade slip that was flying in Han Li’s direction stopped and a faint white blur appeared to the side . She raised her hand and nimble took the jade slip .

“Fellow Daoist Ye!” Han Li narrowed his eyes, recognizing the true figure wrapped in white light . It was Ye Ying, the young white-robed woman .

“Brother Han . It appears you’ve arrived here smoothly and easily . ” The young woman flipped the jade slip in her hand and chuckled .

“What do you mean? Did Fairy Ye encounter trouble on her way here? When I left the Southern Skyline and arrived at the edge of the forest, I waited for you all for a while and I received no messages . What happened to you?” Han Li asked with an odd expression .

“It’s quite simple . Fellow Daoist Long and I encountered a group of wind wyrms in the skyline . We had no choice but to split off . To escape them, we had no choice but to change direction . There were a few other problems along the way . That is why you didn’t see us . ” The young woman sweetly smiled with significant grace .

Han Li felt his heart tremble . He faintly made out something from her words .

Just as he was about to ask her something, a green light flashed from the sky and charged towards them . The light faded away to reveal a man and a woman .

They were Long Dong and Xiao Hong .

“It’s you!”

“As expected, you arrived here first!”

The two spoke with a tone of surprise .

When Xiao Hong saw Han Li’s unharmed appearance, she revealed a trace of surprise, but when Long Dong saw the white-robed woman, he revealed joy .

The white-robed woman looked at the two and casually said, “So it was Brother Long and Fellow Daoist Ye . I wasn’t fast, you were just slow . ”

“Did Lady Ye already grab ahold of the item?” Long Dong glanced at the young woman’s hand and wore a mysterious smile .

Xiao Hong glanced at the jade slip in the white-robed woman’s hand and her expression faintly changed .

The young woman let out a bright laugh and leisurely said, “That’s right . I have it in my hand . In truth, Fellow Daoist Han came here first, but I was still a step ahead of you two . ”

Xiao Hong paused for a second and suddenly asked, “Brother Han, was there only one jade slip here?”

Han Li’s heart stirred, but he nodded with a calm expression .

Xiao Hong fell silent upon hearing Han Li’s answer; Long Dong looked at the white-robed woman silently; and the white-robed woman simply looked down while fiddling with the jade slip in her hand .

For a time, silence filled the air . The heavy atmosphere was an omen for a coming storm .

Xiao Hong’s expression relaxed and she wore a pleasant face . She asked, “Junior Sister Ye, could you let me take a look at the jade slip? The spies we sent to the wood tribe included those from my clan . Perhaps they have some information for my clan . ”

The white-robed woman pursed her lips and then sweetly smiled, “I’m afraid I can’t . I’ll be open and say that the spies had people from my Ye Clan as well . Why don’t I take a look at it first and then tell you about it?”

Xiao Hong’s expression vastly changed and her smile froze . Her gaze became sullen .

Long Dong calmly said, “Since you already have it, we shouldn’t stay here for much longer . Let’s hurry away and talk about it when we leave the forest . ”

“I agree . ” The white-robed woman said .

Xiao Hong’s lip stirred but she raised no objections .

Han Li naturally agreed as well . The young woman smiled and her bright eyes flickered around . Just as she was about to put away the jade slip, a silver streak shot out of the ancient tree behind her . It quickly and silently streaked towards the center of her back .

Although the white-robed woman was faced around, she snorted and her body stirred . Her body grew vague and she disappeared .

A moment later, she appeared over thirty meters away, but there was a silver streak that shot then shot up from the ground .

This time, the young woman’s expression faintly changed .

Her shoulder suddenly blurred and she shot ten meters to the side as if there were a spring underneath her, allowing her to avoid the attack .

But at that moment, the sound of tearing air blew past her .

A near indistinct line of transparent line shot out of a sprace nearby her . The target wasn’t the young woman, but the jade slip in her hand .

Alarmed, the young woman suddenly pulled back her hand, but she was too late .

Bang! The jade slip immediately ruptured, turning into countless shards . In the young woman’s fury, her face warped and she grabbed ahold of the transparent line and fiercely pulled it towards her .

Clang . She dragged out a huge transparent beetle out from the void .

This insect was a meter-long and resembled a huge silkworm, but there were a pair of cicada wings on its back . It fluttered for its life to break free . The end of it that spouted out the thread seemed to be its mouth .

At that moment, the young woman pulled, keeping the insect there .

In the instant the jade slip was destroyed, Han Li and the others were blank in surprise .

At nearly the same time, the remaining ancient trees lit up in green light . Soon after, the ancient tree’s hollow images were dissolved to be replaced with several green silhouettes . It appeared as if they were born from the trees .

A towering silhouette swept their gaze past Han Li and spoke human words in a harsh tone, “Hehe, I didn’t expect that it was hidden there . If you weren’t guiding us, we wouldn’t have found it . Our clan won’t have to worry about later consequences . ”

Han Li glanced at the figure’s appearance and his eyes narrowed .

The person resembled a human, but their skin was green and their eyes were purple . Other than that, they appeared human . Two of the slender figures resembled women .

These silhouettes were wood tribe beings .

What was most astonishing to Han Li was the orange belt they wore at their waist around their long robes .

The belt of the towering being was yellow orange with a silver stripe .

According to what he knew of their grades, Han Li felt his heart plummet .

“A silver tier! You’re a silver tier tree spirit!” When they recognized the towering figure’s belt, the young woman’s expression turned unsightly .

“I am the lower silver tier spirit master Mu Rui . Since you’ve arrived here, there is no need to leave . Allow my clan to welcome you!” The towering figure spoke expressionlessly and waved his hand .

The other orange belted tree beings crouched down and placed their hands against the ground .

A layer of green light suddenly shot out from the hill in every direction at inconceivable speeds .

Han Li and the white-robed woman immediately took off from the ground without another thought .

A huge rumbling sound shook the air and the illusion restriction Han Li placed down was effortlessly destroyed .

Once the illusion was dispersed, the hill’s surroundings were made clear .

Wherever the green light passed, green trees would turn into towering furred beasts . They had a variety of weapons on hand . Their fur had many differing colors as well . There were even monstrous winds that blew into the sky .

Upon closer inspection, there were several thousands of beasts that densely surrounded the hill .

Long Dong and Xiao Hong’s face turned bloodlessly pale .

Han Li wryly smiled . Only the white-robed woman sullenly glared at Mu Rui . It was unknown what she was thinking .

Mu Rui wore a stiff expression, but he spoke with a derisive tone, “These are the Tree Ape Beasts that our tribe spent a thousand years researching . If you looked through that jade slip, you should’ve had information about them, but now . . . ”

“Attack!”

An unfamiliar voice suddenly sounded . Before Han Li and the others realized what was happening, the white-robed young woman suddenly opened her mouth and released a crimson blood light . Suddenly, it turned into several threads and directly shot towards the wood spirits excluding the silver-tier wood spirit .
