Chapter 1319: Jade Fault Pavilion

When Han Li went back inside, he took the jade slip into his hand and pressed it against his forehead, sinking his spiritual sense into it instantly .

A moment later, his expression changed .

Han Li swept his spiritual sense through it with a changing face, “Deep Heaven City is actually this large . It appears even larger than the capital cities in the three human regions . ”

He then stroked the jade slip in his hand for a moment more and casually left the room .

Regardless, he first headed to the Jade Fault Pavilion and make arrangements for his cave residence . From what Zhao Wugui said, there should be something strange about it .

A bit of his interest was piqued .

Just as he committed the location of the Jade Fault Pavilion to memory, he left the pavilion in an azure streak .

As he swept past a dozen giant nearby pagodas, Han Li took a hidden glance at the various cultivators he spotted on the way .

He saw cultivators wearing various sets of armor, but they most commonly appeared near the huge buildings . Those farther away were wearing common cultivator attire from the spirit realm . It was unknown if they had taken off their armor or if they were cultivators not part of the city .

However, there was something he was certain of . You are normally required to wear armor when you enter the huge pagoda . Furthermore, Han Li discovered that yellow and white-armored body refiners used the first few floors of the huge pagodas . The yellow-armored body refiners only possessed mid-grade cultivation while white-armored body refiners had high-grade cultivation .

The number of them entering the huge pagodas was far beyond the cultivators wearing black and azure armor .

When Han Li saw this, he came to understand a bit .

It appeared that Deep Heaven City’s military force was due to the countless soldiers stationed at the huge pagodas . The yellow, white, black, azure, and golden armor were all clear classifications of their fighting power .

After Han Li took a few glances at the huge pagoda and the soldiers, he turned his attention over to his objective .

After about an hour of flight, Han Li eventually caught sight of an extremely tall city wall in the distance . Then, the light around his body darkened and he dropped down to an unremarkable three-story building below him .

Although the building was small and plain, many cultivators were bustling in and out of it .

Han Li simply stopped and placed and examined the building and the streaking lights of flying cultivators for a moment more before he approached the gate .

The pagoda gate’s signboard, the Jade Fault Pavilion”, was written in bold artistic lettering .

Han Li glanced at the sign with narrowed eyes for a long while before he slowly stepped inside .

The first floor had a large hall that was over a hundred meters wide . There were several dozens of cultivators standing in the hall, looking at a huge screen shining in azure light at the very end of the room .

The screen was a map that was six meters tall and over thirty meters wide . Silver specks of light lit up on it, along with a few numbers on occasion . There was also an azure-robed middle-aged man that was standing in front of it with a smile .

Han Li swept his spiritual sense past it and discovered that the cultivators standing in the hall were all at Nascent Soul-stage . As for the azure-robed man, he was a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator .

Suddenly, a skinny old man walked up to the azure-robed man and bowed before handing over an iron plate shining in black light and a storage bracelet .

The middle-aged man took a glance at the iron plate and the storage pouch and flipped his hand with a nod . The storage pouch disappeared and he handed the iron plate back to the old man .

The old man’s spirits immediately trembled . He grabbed the plate and approached the huge math and lightly waved it . Suddenly, a black line shined from its surface and it wrote “2” on one of the silver specks . The speck of light blurred and the number suddenly changed to “3” .

Afterwards, the old man immediately withdrew .

After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, over a dozen people approached the azure-robed man and gave him either an item or some spirit stones . Most of the time, the middle-aged man nodded and gave them a sign on the mark, but there were a few times where he would shake his head and the rejected person would only withdraw dejectedly .

Han Li soon discovered that the huge map displayed the various spirit veins in Deep Heaven City . The deeper the azure light in an area and the greater the number that appeared, more contested the claim of the land . There was even an azure light near some green parts of the map that had an astonishing number of twelve .

When Han Li saw this, he stroked his chin and he remembered what Zhao Wugui said .

It appeared he would have to vie with others for a suitable cave residence .

Suddenly, a clear voice spoke from behind Han Li, “Senior, are you looking for a suitable spirit land to establish your cave residence?”

Han Li slowly turned around with a calm expression .

He saw a slender beautiful woman that was politely standing to the side . Her cultivation was only at Foundation Establishment stage, but it was to be expected given her maid attire .

“That's right, but I’m still looking for a good place . I’m not very satisfied with the spirit mountains here . ” Han Li calmly replied .

“Senior must be a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator . The first floor is only for black-armored guards . Senior should head to the second floor,” the girl said with a smile .

“How did you know I was a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator . You shouldn’t be able to tell with your cultivation . ” Han Li’s heart trembled and a cold glint lit up from his eye .

“There is no need for Senior to be surprised . ” The girl immediately lifted her hand and revealed a palm-sized plate with silver rune characters flashing from it, “Although this Junior’s cultivation is low, I possess a spirit pressure plate . Unless there is a Senior hiding their aura, I can see their cultivation . "

Han Li looked at the plate and felt a bit of a headache .

It was unknown if those human elders have acquired imperial records relating to tool refinement or if their comprehension in this field had reached a stage where they can utilize these understandings in the city .

Either way, this seemed to smash his initial understanding of common conventions . He would have to pay more attention .

If he was caught unaware during a crucial time, some problems would occur .

Of course, none of these thoughts were betrayed by his face . He simply nodded at the girl and had her lead the way upstairs .

There were far fewer people on the second floor, but it appeared far more decorated . Although many areas were set up on the screen, there were simply five people calmly having a seat as they closely examined the map on the screen .

To the side of the screen, there was a large purple-robed man lazily sitting there .

Han Li swept his spiritual sense past the large man and his expression changed . He was an early Spatial Tempering cultivator . As for the people that were studying the map, there were Deity Transformation-stage cultivators like himself . Each of them had a fair maid dressed in similar robes . All of them were exceptionally beautiful and at Foundation Establishment-stage .

Han Li took a deep breath and saluted the large purple-robed man in the distance . Then he followed one of the maids to one of the chairs .

Like the others, the girl stood behind Han Li in a deferential manner .

Han Li glanced at the others and saw they were looking at the green areas on the map .

It appeared they were the mountain ranges in Deep Heaven City . But there were far fewer silver characters on the map than downstairs . Most of them only said 1 or 2 . At most, there were several that said 4, but that was only for one location .

Han Li muttered to himself for a moment, and he waved to the maid behind him . He said, “I’m not too familiar with the spirit lands near here . Can you give me an introduction?”

“Yes, Senior . This map contains the three mountain ranges in the city . The central mountain range, the Jade Rapid Mountains have the most abundant spiritual Qi . This is where most Deity Transformation-stage seniors live . Furthermore, they also have many particular spirit medicines that grow there . This time, there are two Deity Transformation-stage Seniors that hadn’t survived their tribulation, and there is one that also reached the end of this lifespan . According to the rules, their residences have been made available . Many fight for them . The other area is the Heavenly Sound Mountains . Many Deity Transformation-stage cultivators live there as well but the spiritual Qi isn’t as abundant as in Jade Rapid Mountain . As for the Jade Sound Mountain, it is a place that was originally meant for Nascent Soul cultivators . It has recently been opened for use to Deity Transformation-stage Seniors, but I fear it may not be very suitable for you . However, there are very few cave residences placed on the mountain . If Senior wishes to have a large stretch of land exclusive to himself, that may be the better choice . ”

“So it was like that!” Han Li slowly nodded and he took another look at the screen .

The maid tactfully stood back behind Han Li and couldn't help but take another glance at Han Li .

Han Li only appeared to be in his twenties, but he was already a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator . Although she had seen many Deity Transformation cultivators during her time in the Jade Fault Pavilion, seeing one so young had piqued her curiosity .

Suddenly, a wealthily dressed fat man boldly stood a few steps forward and raised an embroidered box and an azure jade pendant . He respectfully brought it up to the large azure-robed man and said, “This Junior recently acquired a talk of Silver Immortal Grass at four thousand years of maturity . Can Senior decide if I have the qualifications to choose a spirit land?”

“Even with one of four thousand years, it will be difficult . Let me take a look . ” The large purple-robed man spoke casually and raised his hand to take the pendant and the box .

When he opened the box, he found a sparkling silver light that released a refreshing medicinal scent .

Even as someone well versed in medicinal plants, when Han Li smelled it, he couldn't help but concede its quality .

The large purple-robed man narrowed his eyes and examined the medicinal plant for a long while before reluctantly saying, “Four thousand years? It seems to be lacking a few hundred, but I’ll let it go . It’ll qualify . ”
