Chapter 1311: Initial Battle with Spatial Tempering

The cloud of blood roiled and instantly condensed into a blood lotus that twirled around its body . Over ten streaks of swordlight were absorbed into it .

The small vial flew over thirty meters away and disappeared into emptiness in the blink of an eye .

When Huan Tianqi arrived and saw this, he let out a furious roar, spitting out a grey demon wind with it . Hail and sand and stone swept over the area Han Li was hidden .

Although the demon wasn’t able to see Han Li’s figure, he was rich with battle experience . He was able to make out that a human using concealment techniques had seized the bottle .

When Han Li saw the demon wind come to attack him, his expression faintly changed .

After he concealed himself, it was impossible for him to immediately fly out of range of the demon wind . Once the wind brushed past him, it would immediately dispel his invisibility talisman .

In that split second, Xu Tian’s face turned sullen and he pointed at the engulfing winds with an incantation gesture .

A red swordlight tore through the air from over the horizon and flew into his hand . It then flashed, cleaving through the demon winds and directly cutting at Hua Tianqi .

Frightened, Hua Tianqi hastily reached out above him .

A grey demon claw immediately appeared and cleaved at the incoming crimson light . The grey and red light intertwined finding themselves in a deadlock for the time being .

When Han Li saw this, he was elated and began to fly away, still concealed .

But then, a cold snort sounded from behind him, “Where do you think you’re going?”

He suddenly sensed something flash from the yellow mist and a white jade seal strangely warped above his head . In a blur, it turned over thirty-meters-large and pounded down towards Han Li .

The attack was lightning swift . Xu Tian shouted, knowing it was too late for him to help .

Han Li had already witnessed its might and when the giant pounded it, it was entirely unscathed .

He absolutely couldn't receive the strike .

His expression wavered several times before he let out a sigh .

As the jade seal pressed down, silver light flashed and revealed Han Li .

Han Li slapped the roof of his head and summoned a small cauldron wrapped in azure light . He opened it to release a string of clear cries, followed by a barrage of countless azure threads . They quickly waved together a net of light to catch the seal above him .

The seal continued to press down, dropping right on top of the net .

A chain of explosions ruptured . The seal appeared unharmed as usual, and the azure net began to slowly crumble . However, the Heavenvoid Cauldron was a Divine Spirit Treasure . With another wave of azure threads, it completely halted the jade seal’s momentum .

Han Li grasped his hands in an incantation gesture to use this opportunity . Thunder cried, followed by the appearance of azure-white wings on his back .

His body seemed to twist as he turned into a white line, disappearing along with the small cauldron .

When the seal broke free of the net of light, it naturally fell on top of nothing .

At that moment, azure lightning flashed over a hundred meters away where Han Li silently reappeared .

“How are you able to control that treasure? You aren’t Shi Yan!”

Xu Tian’s inconceivable voice sounded from within the blood cloud . Then it roiled to reveal a silhouette that was several inches tall . The profound spirit Xu Tian looked at Han Li with furious alarm .

“You aren’t from the spirit clan! You’re a human cultivator!” Light flashed from the yellow mist to reveal Spirit Lord Huang Liang, looking at Han Li with an astonished fash .

Huan Tianqi used this opportunity to scatter the crimson sword light and flashed forward to Huang Liang’s side, examining Han Li with bewilderment as well .

Facing the Spatial Tempering-stage existences, Han Li simply opened his mouth with an incantation gesture formed and spat out a mist of blood .

Soon after, a dense mist of blood enveloped him .

“He wants to run!” When Xu Tian saw this, he saw that it was a profound movement technique and he furiously shouted .

Soon after, the blood cloud stirred beneath Han Li as if it were ready to pounce .

Huan Tianqi snorted and said, “Fellow Daoist Xu Tian, there is no need to be so anxious . I merely want to experience your Bloodfiend Spirit Lotus . Brother Han Li, since he’s a human cultivator, you deal with him . ” His form then turned half-demon in an instant and his body blurred as he pounced towards Xu Tian .

Huang Liang stared at Han Li and indifferently said, “Don’t worry, he is a trifling Deity Transformation-stage cultivator . Even with a spirit treasure, he will not escape me .

He then glanced at the Heavenvoid Cauldron at Han Li’s side .

As soon as those words were said, he opened his mouth and spat a small green sword . It blurred and arrived above the blood mist with wyrm-like agility .

A clang lightly sounded as a golden light shot out from the mist . Although it was repelled from the impact, it managed to block the green sword .

The golden light revealed itself to be a foot-long flying sword .

Huang Liang sneered and pointed at his sword .

The green streak flew immediately intertwining with the flying golden sword . Under the bright clash, the golden light found itself further pressured and restrained as the green streak began to revolve and turn into a meter-long wheel, revolving at a force that would crush anything in its path .

A series of sharp metal clangs sounded, but strangely enough, the golden sword appeared almost entirely unscathed from the fierce blows apart from growing dimmer .

Instead, the flying sword continued to forcibly tangle with the azure sword and distract it .

Huang Liang let out a yelp and his face stirred .

Although he hadn’t refined the green sword from extraordinary materials, when he completed the first cycle of cultivation, he honed it with several thousand years of effort . Its might already was equivalent to a spirit treasure, but now it was being repelled by the flying sword of a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator .

He was thoroughly shocked, but he retained a calm appearance and quickly formed an incantation gesture, causing his sword to let out a ring . It blurred as it turned into thirty-six identical copies . They all cleaved at the blood mist in a dense barrage of attack, intending on skewering Han Li’s corpse .

But what Huang Liang couldn't have expected was for Han Li’s back to blur, summoning tens of small golden swords as well . They all flew out in sword streaks and blocked the azure lights, letting not one of them through .

At that moment, the blood mist was growing violently unstable as Han Li continued to chant . His ten fingers began to cycle through incantation gestures as if he was about to finish his spell .

When Spirit Lord Huang Liang saw this, his astonishment was clear to see, but a cold glint soon shined from his eye . Soon after, yellow mist brightly lit up and he vanished .

Han Li let out a deep sigh and suddenly crimson marks flashed on his brow, followed by the appearance of a black eye-ball . It immediately released a thin beam of jet-black light before disappearing .

Thirty meters away, a loud boom shook the air . Yellow mist and black light flickered together to reveal Spirit Lord Huang Liang . He cried out in alarm, “You have such a treasure? An annihilating treasure!”

The Spatial Tempering-stage cultivator wore a grim expression, but after some surprise, there was neither rage nor joy .

He raised his hand and slowly reached his hand out in front of him .

The sounds of tearing space erupted above Han Li’s head and the winds drew up a storm nearby . Countless threads of mist appeared in the nearby air, condensing into a ball of light in th blink of an eye . A three-meter-long crystalline jade axe appeared in the air .

Huang Liang made a first with his hand and waved down, uttering, “Cleave . ”

The rainbow jade axe trembled and slowly moved down, but before the axe drew close, lightning rang .

Balls of azure lightning flickered off of the axe, warping the nearby space it touched . The might’s axe was beyond what it displayed .

As he still casted from within the blood mist, Han Li’s expression changed .

Without another thought, he opened his mouth and spat out a small black mountain . It trembled to release halos of grey light from its surface . Where ever the strange halo of light passed through any of the azure swordlight’s, they let out a wail and trembled uncontrollably as if they were stunned .

The huge jade axe clearly wasn’t comparable to the azure swordlight, however . It easily brushed past the halos and scattered them with ease .

Han Li’s heart grew tense and the small mountain burst, suddenly condensing a dozen rings of light together into an incredibly dense halo . It disappeared with a trembled, suddenly reappearing nearby the jade axe and quickly wrapping around it .

The rainbow light on the axe’s surface pulsed in resistance, but then, the axe suddenly lost control .

Huang Liang was completely aghast by the sight of this . Without another thought, he shouted and released a chain of spell seals .

Suddenly, the jade axe let out a roll of thunder and a series of azure lightning bolts exploded, fiercely cleaving down and tearing through the grey halo .

But that moment of delay bought Han Li just enough time . He suddenly blurred in a crimson streak and he left the blood mist . At an inconceivable speed, he arrived hundreds of kilometers away, a mere black speck in the horizon .

As for his flying swords and the small black mountain, they disappeared as well .

With his Deity Transformation-stage cultivation and his fiercely powerful body, this life-saving evasion technique possessed inconceivable speeds . In several flickers, he already disappeared from sight .

At that moment, Spirit Lord Huang Liang and the others ceased their fighting and looked into the distance with shock .

The three yelled with alarm at nearly the same time and cast incantation gestures at nearly the same instant, streaking forward in furious pursuit .

Several seconds later, the nearby skies were completely empty, the three flying at a speed nearly comparable to the Bloodshadow Evasion .
