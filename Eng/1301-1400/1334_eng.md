Chapter 1334: Clear Jade Pills

Han Li rejoiced at being able his wanted items with ease .

He sat in a simple bamboo chair and sipped on some spirit tea in a leisurely manner .

A while later, the middle-aged shopkeeper came back with a storage bracelet .

When he arrived in front of Han Li, he swiped his hand past the storage bracelet and took out a white and a blue jade slip . He then took out a large assortments of boxes and bottles, placing them on the side of the table .

Then he respectfully stood there and waited .

Han Li swept his gaze and summoned the two jade slips into his hand before immersing his spiritual sense into them .

“The Clearjade Pill and the True Toad Liquid,” Han Li muttered to himself . He frowned and withdrew his spiritual sense .

The Clear Jade Pill was acceptable . It used rare medicinal herbs, some of which he hadn’t heard before . A majority of the herbs had to be at two or three thousand years of maturity, but they were considered quite common . As for the True Toad Liquid, it was rather odd . The liquid’s primary ingredient was the spirit blood of an ancient beast in the wilderness called the green-eyed toad . It had common supplementary ingredients . While both could be used by Deity Transformation-stage cultivators, the Clear Jade Pill was only useful to early Deity Transformation-stage cultivators . It had diminished results in mid-stage cultivators .

The True Toad Liquid is much stronger but was more suited for late-Deity Transformation stage cultivators . If used at mid stage, the overbearing medicinal power could pose a great risk .

With his eyes shut, he began to think about the medicine’s usage, refinement and portioning . Then he opened his eyes and examined the boxes and medicines on the table .

As the middle-aged shopkeeper said, he lacked about half of the materials required for the medicines . The toad’s spirit blood obviously wasn’t there .

Han Li stroked his chin and asked, “Are the missing ingredients something I can purchase at other shops? Since the True Blue-eyed Toad is an ancient beast from the wilderness, it should be difficult to find . ”

“The required materials for the Clear Jade Pill doesn’t really need medicines of the right maturation . It can be refined even with plants of lesser age, but its effects will be lacking . They can be acquired so long as Senior has enough spirit stones . As for the toad’s spirit blood, it is a truly rare material . Although it will go on sale occasionally, it will be immediately bought . There are one of the most in-demand materials for large medicine stores . It won’t be easy for Senior to acquire this item . However, there will soon be an auction where it might be sold . ”

“So it was like that . I want those items . ” After some consideration, Han Li nodded .

“Many thanks for your business, Senior . I will give you the bill . Two pill formulas is a hundred thousand spirit stones, the three stalks of five thousand-year-old gold herb is . . . ” With a smile, the shopkeeper hastily spoke and began to list out the prices of the items on the table .

Han Li simply narrowed his eyes as he listened, betraying nothing from his face .

After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Han Li calmly left the medicine store and entered another store nearby .

As such, he began to stroll through all the medicine shops nearby as if planning to visit all the medicine shops on the street .

In other medicine stores, Han Li gathered together eight other useful pill formulas, but they required materials that were even harder to obtain that the spirit blood of the True Blue-eyed Toad . Han Li had no choice but to put them off . So long as he could acquire the required materials for these medicines, he would spare no money .

However, he wouldn’t gather extremely expensive materials, but seeds or young stalks .

This way, Han Li could acquire large quantities of materials without bankrupting himself .

As a result, he acquired all the medicinal herbs he required for the Clear Jade Pill and more . After he matured the herbs using the spirit liquid, he’d be able to start refining the pills .

Of course, it wasn’t easy to refine medicine that could be used by Deity Transformation-stage cultivators . With his attainments in pill refinement, he may need to take multiple attempts to make a pill .

With Han Li’s small bottle, he had unlimited attempts, so he had nothing to worry about .

As for the True Toad Liquid, it was something he required .

He would have to purchase it in the coming auction .

Han Li felt somewhat apprehensive .

But before the auction, he would need to acquire more spirit stones . He was currently lacking them, so he would have to trade for more .

In the spirit realm, spirit stones were abundant, causing the price of items to be several times more than in the mortal realm .

Of course, even with more spirit stones in the mortal realm, it would still be impossible to acquire the ingredients needed for Deity Transformation-stage pills .

Han Li with confident that with enough medicine pills, he would be able to advance a grade without a problem .

Having come to that conclusion, he quietly entered an empty corner of a street .

He looked around him to see that no one was looking and a series of cracks sounded from his body . He shortly transformed into a large man with a purple face .

Afterwards, Han Li strut into a large store by the name of the Revival Hall .

In the markets of the spirit realm, thousand year spirit medicines weren’t as rare as in the mortal realm . But when Han Li presented several stalks of medicine at eight thousand years of maturation, the shopkeeper exchanged them for an astronomical sum of spirit stones without any hesitation .

Han Li grabbed the spirit stones and nimbly departed . He didn’t stay in one place for long in order to avoid attention .

Han Li didn’t depart from the city . Instead, he walked past several streets and took note of the various magic tools, treasures, materials, and talismans that were on sale .

As a result, he had gained much experience .

It was clear the spirit realm was filled with abundant materials . The quality and might of treasures here far exceeded that in the mortal realm . Even larger stores had fantastical spirit treasures on sale .

As for talismans and secret seals, they were even more fantastical, much to Han Li’s surprise . They were beyond the mortal world’s talismans .

There were several talismans among them that were written in silver runes .

The majority of these talismans were either assistive or defensive, with hardly any offensive types among them . The few he saw held astonishing prices . But there were talismans with a silver silhouette that caught his interest .

Han Li asked all the store owners about it and came to know that they all came from the Heaven Spirit Region . These silver rune talismans were puppet talismans .

One can summon the puppet phantom that is inscribed in the talisman . Its abilities and might depend on the refinement quality and the skill of its user .

It was said that the finest puppet talismans could even mimic the cultivation and techniques of its user . It was a rather practical talisman .

After he was finished, his heart stirred and he couldn't help but think of the damaged jade book remnants in his possession .

The talisman attainments it detailed also mentioned the refinement method for a puppet talisman, but he hadn’t researched it . As the selling cost of these talismans was incredible, he’d have to take a proper look at them .

With that in mind, Han Li bluntly looked for too talisman stores and picked up the materials he needed to refine silver rune talismans in large quantity .

With that done, Han Li leisurely made his way to the auction site, the Profound Zenith Hall where human and demons mixed .

Although the auction was still two days away, he wanted to take a look at what the demons were trading .

After all, demon clan hadn’t participated in human auctions .

In order to prevent any clashes from occurring in the hall in the middle of business, human cultivators that wanted to trade needed to carry a palm-sized jade pendant .

So long as the jade pendant was on their body, it would immediately conceal them in a white mist and would also restrict the user’s cultivation . In addition, if anyone in the hall used their magic power, the grand formation in the hall would not only restrict their abilities, but it would also teleport them outside . They wouldn’t be able to enter for a short time .

The demon clan’s side had a black banner that hid their appearance in a demon cloud as well .

In addition, there were four Spatial Tempering-stage gold guards from both races standing at guard . There were also ten dark azure guards preserving order on either side .

Such power naturally prevented anything unwanted from occurring .

In order to enter, Han Li had to pay a large number of spirit stones . He took a jade pendant from the guard and put it on his waist, producing a white mist around them . Then he walked down a long corridor and through a large gate .

As a result, he arrived in a large hall over a kilometer long with an exact door on the other side .

There were over a hundred white and black balls of mist in the hall, each representing a human or demon .

There were thirty of them sitting cross-legged on the ground with several items laid out in front of them . They were all silent .

Most people stood by the vendor stalls, carefully examined items, or had quiet discussions with the vendors . There were also blurs occasionally spotted in the hall . From time to time, people who hide in a corner and have their secret discussions there .

Han Li stood in place and looked at his surroundings . He then wordlessly walked over to a nearby vendor’s booth .

The vendor was hidden in a silver mist, showing he was human .

Placed in front of him were two odd items .

One of them was a faint green and resembled a branch . The other was a sparkling crimson stone about the size of a fist .
