Chapter 1359: Undercurrents

A ball of faint white light floated out from the forest . It contained a longboat that stretched over sixty meters wide .

The boat was divided into two stories and seemed to be crafted entirely from fine jade . The boat was engraved with simple cloud designs . Gold and silver talisman characters also floated from its surface, producing an unordinary aura .

The jade boat shuddered . Suddenly, the silver and golden talisman characters exploded, turning into a white cloud that wrapped around the boat . The entire boat appeared like an unremarkable white cloud .

The huge cloud soon circled in the air and silently rushed off .

Although the cloud appeared to be gently flying through the air, it traveled at extreme speed, tearing through three hundred meters in an instant . Its speed was comparable to an ordinary Deity Transformation cultivator .

As Xiao Hong stood on top of the boat, she looked around and praised, “Not bad . Although a spirit boat suitable for travel can’t be considered rare, one this fast is a top-grade good . As expected for the Long Clan, an owner of a human auction house . ”

Long Dong politely said, “Hehe, Fairy Xiao praises me too greatly . Your clan is one of the seven great demon clans . You must’ve seen every kind of treasure . My Spirit Cloud Boat’s speed can’t be more than acceptable in your eyes . However, the boat does have quite a space . There are at least a dozen rooms . Apart from one person needing to keep watch on the outside, everyone else can rest in a room . If it goes smoothly, we’ll arrive in half a year . With some cultivation, it’ll pass by quickly . ”

Xiao Hong nodded, “That is good . We’ll take ten days turns keeping watch while the others can do as they wish on the boat . Everyone should select their rooms first . ”

The others raised no objections and found a satisfactory room on the boat .

Since it was their place to rest and meditate, they placed down other restrictions in the room to protect them from prying eyes .

Then after a short discussion, the watch rotation was decided .

As it so happened, Han Li was the last position in the rotation . That gave him forty days before he had to keep watch .

With all of that arranged, Han Li didn’t chat more with the others and headed into his room instead .

The others had done the same, apart from Long Dong, who held the first watch .

With Long Dong alone on board, his lips twitched and he made his way to the front of the boat . He flipped his hand and produced a green mat .

He then sat down on it cross-legged .

The blood marked youth quietly muttered, “Half a year . . . I look forward to the day that arrives . ” Then, he slowly closed his eyes and wore an odd smile on his face .

In a room ten meters wide, Xiao Hong and the white-browed youth took a seat across from each other .

“What? You’re saying that young girl Ye Ying possesses Heavenly Phoenix Blood and is a disciple of the True Spirit Noble Clan?” The youth said with an astonished face .

Xiao Hong solemnly said, “Why is Fellow Daoist Li so surprised . Your Dark Falcon Clan is also a rare species of bird . You must’ve felt something . As for our Black Phoenix Clan, although we are a side branch of the phoenix clan, the purity of our heavenly phoenix blood is far greater than what that girl possesses . But there is no doubt about the presence of phoenix blood in her body . ”

The white-browed sighed and wore an odd expression, “So it was like that! When I first saw that girl, I felt ill at ease, like there was a slight sensation of fear, so I was somewhat at a loss when we entered the forest . So why did Fairy Xiao tell me this?”

“It’s just that if the girl has other true spirit blood on her, it would’ve been fine . But she has the Heavenly Phoenix Blood of the myriad bird king . Brother Li should understand what this means . ” Xiao Hong sweetly smiled, but her eyes were ice cold .

The white-browed youth grew silent for a moment before letting out a cold laugh . “Of course I understand . But don’t forget how important the elders told us to treat this mission . If we let personal matters get in the way of the clan’s mission, then our lives are forfeit, regardless if we managed to acquire Heavenly Phoenix Blood . ”

Xiao Hong chuckled, “When did I say I wanted to attack her before the mission was over . We’ll have to first make sure that the mission is completed . Then we’ll strike . ”

“Strike after the mission is over? Oh, if it doesn’t affect the mission, that’ll be possible . But will the other two help her? Even if we take back the True Phoenix Blood, how will we divide it? The blood can’t be evenly divided . ” The white-browed youth blinked and he shook his head .

Xiao Hong gritted her teeth and said, “The Heavenly Phoenix Blood is useful to us both, but its effects are more pronounced on those from the Black Phoenix Clan . How about this? If Brother Li helped me acquire the spirit blood, I am willing to reward him with three black flame pills . As for the other two, I have a plan to deal with them . Furthermore, the Black Leaves Forest wasn’t a safe area to begin with . They might not safely return . ”

“Three Black Flame Pills? You aren’t joking?” The white-browed youth said with delight .

Xiao Hong wryly smiled and said, “I have some status in the Black Phoenix Clan . Although the pills are considered priceless, after many years, I’ve managed to accumulate enough ingredients for three . I planned on using them to enter Spatial Tempering stage . ”

After a moment of thought, the youth frowned and said, “So it was like that . I’ll lend you a hand after the mission is over . However, the blood won’t be easy to take . Especially true blood from the true spirit noble clans . It will be difficult to acquire after they fused it into their human bodies . ”

“Don’t worry, the Black Phoenix Clan have a particular method of extracting true blood . It had been well researched . I have an eighty percent chance at the very least . ”

When the white-browed youth heard this, he nodded, “Since you are so confident, then fine . ”

. . .

In the other room, the young white-robed woman Ye Ying clasped her hands with an incantation gesture . She was sitting cross-legged on the bed . There was a meter-wide azure halo slowly floating behind her head .

Upon closer inspection, the halo was perfectly round with foot-tall white flames flickered from its edges . There was also a hollow silhouette meditating at its center .

From its appearance through its radiance, it appeared similar to the woman, but was several times smaller . Its eyes were shut and its hand was held in an incantation gesture .

At an unknown time, the young woman’s mouth began to stir and an indistinct smile appeared on her face . At nearly the same time, the image in the halo wore a similar expression .

. . .

As Han Li paced in the secluded room, he wore an expressionless face and his eyes flickered as if he were lost in thought .

In the corner of the room, there were two small objects on the jade table .

There was a kitten sized leopard with its four legs lazily stretched out on the table next to the items .

Sitting on the small leopard’s head was a monkey only several inches tall . Black light lit up from its fur and it looked at Han Li with intelligent eyes .

Han Li suddenly stopped pacing and he flipped his hand to produce a white jade slip and a small bottle .

The bottle was simply decorated and had three ancient characters engraved on it . Under closer inspection, the words read Earth Cleansing Pill .

Han Li stroked the bottle with a finger and then sighed . In a flash of light, the bottle disappeared . All that remained was a jade slip .

The jade slip was something that was given to him by several mysterious cultivators before he left Deep Heaven City .

Han Li fiddled with the jade slip for a while before placing it against his forehead .

The jade slip continued a huge map, but it seemed to be mostly incomplete . The map’s lacking areas were shining with faint golden light .

Although he looked through it continuously, Han Li couldn't help but continue as if he was trying to find something inside it .

. . .

Countless kilometers away from Deep Heaven City, there was a hidden underground room where a monk and a Daoist sat across from each other next to a stone table .

The Daoist appeared over forty years old . He had big eyes, thick eyebrows, and faintly golden skin .

The monk appeared old and had a white beard that was a half-foot long . Wrinkles littered his face and his eyes were thin lines as if he couldn't open them .

“It is about time for them to meet together and head on their way . ” The old man said weakly .

“Yes, but there is something that eludes me . Why did Brother Jin Yue suddenly changed from his original plan after he left seclusion? Why did you send those Juniors to a foreign land?

Those people were supposed to be the most outstanding of the newly ascended cultivators . You should clearly understand that the mission to receive intelligence from the foreign land may seem simple, but it is truly dangerous . The demon clans would send equivalent people, but in truth, they seem to have other plans . ” The Daoist priest spoke with a puzzled face .

“The various races have become restless . You should know this . ” The old monk said .

When the Daoist Priest heard the old monk, his heart trembled and he wore a solemn expression . “Of course . But there is a newly appeared profound heavenly treasure that is listed on the chaotic myriad spirit roll . Furthermore, it is a profound heavenly treasure that ranks in the top three . The Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword!”
