Chapter 1391: Escaping

It was clear that the figures were a result of Han Li’s abilities .

Following that, black light flashed from the top of the giant’s head . Another azure figure flickered into space and silently swept down .

However, the giant already anticipated this and he raised his head, releasing an emerald green beam of light from his head .

The beam of light was as thick as a barrel and incredibly fast . As a result, the azure figure was unable to dodge and took the blow directly .

A miserable scream sounded, followed by the fall of the azure figure .

The giant sneered .

But then, purple light shined from behind the figure, radiating brightly . Another silhouette inconceivable appeared . It waved its sleeve and released hundreds of golden specks of light .

The newly-appeared silhouette was Han Li .

At such a close distance, even the giant immediately sensed the azure figure, but he was too late to stop it .

He only heard the sharp patter of rain as the golden specks all struck the back of the giant .

Enraged, the giant roared and a large green hand warped, arriving above Han Li’s head . It overbearingly swept down .

Han Li didn’t panic . He unfolded his wings, wanting to flicker into a void .

But then, the giant flicked two of his fingers with a cold snort . Their fingernails shot off in a tremble and disappeared in a blur .

A moment later, two green streaks pierced through Han Li’s wings at inconceivable speed . The sounds of thunder suddenly stopped .

In great alarm, Han Li thought of another way to dodge, but it was too late .

The giant’s hand radiated with green light and Han Li felt his surroundings grow tense as if it had turned to steel . Even with the immense power of his body, Han Li’s movements slowed and he found it difficult to escape .

In that delay, the giant green hand firmly grabbed him .

The green giant’s strength was absolutely no weaker than Han Li’s .

The giant sinisterly smiled at seeing his strike land true and revealed a violent expression .

Green light surged through his hand as he exerted strength in his hand, intending on crushing Han Li alive .

Han Li’s face largely changed and he suddenly muttered an incantation . Azure light continued to surge through his body, glaring from the giant’s hand . Then, his body seemed to become crushed as it turned into specks of light .

The spirit light condensed in a nearby space, creating an azure talisman . Suddenly, it swept off into the distance .

The giant looked at the display with surprise .

A hundred meters away, space fluctuated, followed by the flicker of Han Li’s appearance . Although he was somewhat pale, he quickly collected himself and summoned the azure talisman into his hand .

As he found himself in a moment of peril, he used the Spiritform Talisman’s ability to substitute himself, thus allowing him to escape calamity and displace himself a distance away .

After tempering the talisman for so many years, the Spiritform Talisman’s abilities were far greater than before .

At that moment, the giant spat out a beam of light at the silhouette, suddenly blurring as he approached the haggard Han Li .

However, despite Han Li’s ruined clothing and pale complexion, he turned to look at the giant with a sinister smile .

Astonishingly, this was a different “Han Li . ”

The giant blinked and couldn't help but show his bewilderment .

The “Han Li” before him immediately lit up with black light and suddenly shrunk into a black-haired monkey that was only a half-foot tall .

It was the Weeping Soul Beast!

When Han Li launched his previous attack, he secretly released the Weeping Soul Beast and had it take his form .

The Silver Tier Wood Spirit had been too distracted to notice . With the protection of his illusions and the Weeping Soul Beast, he activated the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman and was able to quietly escape .

Otherwise, with the Wood Spirit’s immense spiritual sense, Han Li truly wouldn’t have been able to fool the giant at such a close distance .

The green giant faintly sensed that something was amiss and recalled the golden specks that Han Li released from his sleeve . Then, his expression sank as he swiped at his back .

As one that was both person and tree, the wood spirit’s body was extremely hardy, but his body’s senses was dull . Originally, he didn’t believe that Han Li had a true method of harming him .

But after he swiped his hand behind him, his eyes lit up as he discovered several inch-large golden beetles laying in his palm .

“What is this?”

The huge giant was startled and soon he clenched his hand, but he unfolded it to discover the beetles were safe .

His face drastically changed .

When Han Li saw this from a distance, a fierce expression appeared on his face and he gave the beetles a command with his spiritual sense .

Suddenly, the giant’s back flared with golden light as half-foot-long golden beetles began to strangely appear . They crawled over half of the giant’s body and began wildly devouring it .

Han Li watched with an emotionless expression, but his heart stirred .

Although the Gold Devouring Beetles were said to have nothing they couldn't eat, that was only a record in the mortal realm . It was also recorded that wood and jade treasures could restrain them . The wood spirit tribe’s half-human half-tree fusion was truly bizarre . Although their bodies resembled huge trees, he wasn’t able to determine if they could be considered wood-type treasures .

As the experiment went on, the giant soon let out a scream of agony . He slapped at his back with all his might, but the beetles continued to fiercely consume him . He near-indestructible crystalline body was now being easily torn apart by the beetles .

With several hundred of these beetles gnawing away at the giant, the giant sensed the agony of being torn apart despite his dulled senses .

Han Li was overjoyed . After he waved his sleeve to collect the Weeping Soul Beast, his body lit up with azure light and he tore through the sky as an azure streak .

Although the Gold Devouring Beetles were enough to deal with the giant, he couldn’t deal with any of the giant’s full-powered attacks . It’d be best if he put distance between them .

“Gold Devouring Beetles! Fully matured Gold Devouring Beetles! You actually possessed such demonic insects!” The giant’s screams sounded as if it was having a most fearsome nightmare .

Soon after, the sounds of repeated explosions sounded and green lights instantly filled most of the sky .

Han Li didn’t turn around and continued his escape with all his speed . In the blink of an eye, he was over the horizon . After several more flickers, he was long gone .

A short moment later, a huge ball of light raised to the sky where the giant originally stood . It flew off past the sky in defeat . The faint silhouette of the badly damage giant could be seen within .

There was a cloud of golden insects closely pursuing it .

With one trailing after another, they flew off a different direction from Han Li .

Not long after, the golden beetle cloud buzzed as they circled and flew back . Not only did they return to their inch-large size, but beetles flew in unorganized disarray .

Fortunately, the Gold Devouring Beetles weren’t slow . They streaked past the air like bolts of lightning .

Five hundred kilometers away in an area with scattered rocks, Han Li sat cross-legged with a pale complexion . He was doing his utmost to command the beetles back to him .

He already consumed a truly significant portion of his spiritual sense .

When the beetles finally returned to him, he eventually lost control of his body as it trembled and fell . At that same time, he put his hands behind his head and let out a painful groan .

A quarter hour later, he was able to collect himself and sit back up .

Using the beetles had been extremely dangerous, resulting in nearly all his spiritual sense being wasted . But even so, his spiritual sense only suffered minor damage .

It seemed he wouldn’t be able to use the beetles for pursuit to prevent excessive drain .

Nevertheless, if he hadn’t pursued the wood spirit with the Gold Devouring Beetles, the wood spirit would have discovered something amiss and wouldn’t have given up so easily .

Now, the Silver Tier Wood Spirit suffered much damage from the Gold Devouring Beetles . Even if he was braver, he wouldn’t dare to continue tangling with Han Li .

Han Li stroked the Spirit Beast Ring underneath his sleeves and let out a long breath .

In a secret forest myriad kilometers away, the Silver Tier Wood Spirit Mu Rui was sitting underneath a huge tree in his giant form . One of his arms and nearly half of his body had disappeared, but countless green specks of light flew out from the forest and wildly rushed into his body .

The giant’s missing body parts regrew at a visible speed .

In the time it took to finish a cup of tea, the specks of light ceased and the giant’s body was completely restored . But when he opened his eyes, they now appeared exceptionally dim .

He held his hands in an incantation gesture and the giant’s body spat out a hollow phantom . It then blurred and condensed into a pale green-skinned wood spirit .

The giant then flashed with light and scattered away, turning into a huge tree .

After the wood spirit returned to its original form, he glanced in the direction where he fought with Han Li .

“How very troublesome . This person possesses hundreds of Gold Devouring Beetles . If I were in peak condition, I could take the risk of killing him and have the beetles lose control .

But after receiving two heavy injuries in succession, I suffered too much damage to my spirit tree . If I encounter those beetles again, I might truly die . It appears that I have no choice but to give up pursuit . ” After his expression wavered while in thought, he eventually shook his head and came to a decision .

He turned into a ball of silver light and soared back in the direction of Black Leaves Forest .

Not long after, Han Li restored a portion of his spiritual sense in another area . Not daring to stay in the area any longer, he suppressed his migraine and tore through the sky in an azure streak .

He was heading in the direction of the Southern Skyline .

Two months later, Han Li arrived above a barren plateau . Soon after, he sought out a small earthy mountain in a remote place and burrowed into it with a yellow flash .

In the heart of the mountain, he easily dug out a hidden room thirty-meters-wide and put it into order . Then, he drank several medicine pills and sat down cross-legged .

A month later, Han Li opened his eyes, revealing their recovered spirit . His spirit, mind, and body made a full recovery .
