Chapter 1353: Foreign Tribe Suspicions

He flicked his fingers and five dense bolts of lightning lashed out . Another light flashed from his hand to produce a square embroidered cloth drifting downward . Its surface faintly glowed with strange talisman characters in a mysterious fashion .

When the green shadow saw this, he was alarmed but not frightened . Instead, he shook his shoulder, summoning two grey shadows from his back . In a blur, they split off to confront the oncoming lightning and cloth .

The green shadow then twisted his body, wanting to create some distance .

An icy harrumph sounded from the winged silhouette above him .

An inconceivable event followed!

As soon as the green shadow heard him, he violently trembled . Afterwards, his figure stopped and was left in a daze .

A rolling thunder rang and the five bolts of golden lightning were the first to strike the shadow puppet .

Upon contact, the grey shadow dissolved from the golden light like ice to the sun . A grey mist was all that was left behind .

Simultaneously, the odd talisman characters on the embroidered cloth lit up and ruptured . Myriads of fine silver threads covered the grey shadow and immediately retracted it back into the cloth, holding the shadow puppet firmly in place .

Thunder rang from the embroidered cloth, and countless arcs of lightning leaped out, attacking the immobile shadow puppet .

At that moment, the winged silhouette flapped his wings and immediately disappeared with the flash of a silver line .

A moment later, the silver line appeared above the green shadow . The winged silhouette then waved his hand in a casual motion .

His palm sparkled with light and soon light lit up from his fingers, releasing five various colored bone rings .

The rings were as fine as jade with pea-sized skulls meticulously carved from their surface . The eyes in the skulls stirred and the skull opened its mouth as if it were alive .

The five skulls release different colored glacial flames, and they fused together to create a gorgeous barrier of rainbow flame .

Just as he collected himself from being intimidated before, the green shadow saw flames light from in front of him as he was about to be engulfed in rainbow flames .

He felt his entire body tensed and felt it become incredibly slow .

In the next moment, the green shadow felt great terror .

However, he was a high-grade existence in the shadow clan . He instantly let out a piercing shriek from his mouth, causing his green body to burst into countless green threads . They scattered in every direction to avoid being trapped by the rainbow flames .

The winged silhouette seemed to have already anticipated this and suddenly swiped down with his other hand .

Light lit up from it and the image of a small black mountain was faintly revealed from his hand . With a flip of his hand, rings of grey light suddenly rushed out from his palm .

When the grey light flew out, the green threads seemed to have encountered their match . As the rings swept the green threads inside of them, they were instantly crushed and turned to green dust .

At that moment, the green shadow’s crimson eyes were filled with terror .

However, his body felt immense pressure as if the land itself was weighing down on him . Against such a powerful ability, he couldn't muster himself to escape .

Winds tore as differently colored light shot out from the winged silhouette’s hands, placing a series of talismans on the green shadow .

The green shadow blurred and the crimson light gradually faded from his eyes .

An inconceivable event occurred .

Under the restriction of the talismans, the green shadow began to shrink until he was only a fist-sized green ball that weakly pulsed with faint green light .

The winged silhouette didn’t find this odd in the slightest and withdrew his abilities . He simply reached his hand out in the air .

The green ball immediately tore through the air and easily arrived in the person’s hand .

At that moment, the winged silhouette turned to the dumbstruck azure-armored old man and said with a smile, “Fellow Daoist Yue, I’m afraid I’ve arrived too late . Are you alright?”

The old man eventually collected himself and withdrew the flying sword in front of him . He returned the smile and saluted the man, “Brother Han, what are you saying? Had you not saved my life, I fear I would’ve been in trouble . I’ve long heard of your exceptional abilities, and now I see those rumors are entirely true! Even a high-grade Shadow Tribe member isn’t enough to be your match . ”

The winged silhouette was actually a youth wearing a set of azure armor, Han Li!

But at that moment, Han Li already progressed his cultivation to mid-Deity Transformation stage .

Han Li chuckled in response and said, “Brother Yue is exaggerating . It's just that my techniques happen to be effective against the Shadow Tribe members . If it were another foreign race, my attacks wouldn’t have been effective .

“Hehe, Fellow Daoist Han is quite modest . Who could’ve known that your small squad would suffer no casualties during decades of patrol assignments? I heard in those years, you’ve killed quite a few foreign tribe spies . Tch tch, considering all your merits, my praise hadn’t been enough . ” The old man wryly laughed and shook his head .

“Nonsense, so the other Fellow Daoists must be alright?” Han Li chuckled and then he looked around .

“There should be any problems . Since that Shadow Tribe member has been restrained, the puppets he controlled should’ve dispersed . My subordinates had been earlier possessed, but since only a short time had passed, their vitality will only be a bit damaged in the worst case . So why did you come across this place? Where are your subordinates?” When the old man saw that Han Li didn’t want to continue that conversation, he tactfully changed the topic .

Han Li took out a jade box from his storage bracelet and put the restrained green shadow in it . Then he calmly answered, “Hehe, it was only a matter of luck . I recently acquired a high-grade Foreign Spirit Plate, so it gives me a broader range . I happened to be patrolling with my squad in a nearby area and the plate rang . As for my subordinates, I ordered them to stay in place before I took off . ”

“So it was like that . I’ve managed to escape calamity through luck alone!” The old man sighed .

At that moment, the two black-armored guards nearby approached Han Li and uttered deep thanks for his timely arrival .

From a distance, the other cultivators were returning and arrived before Han Li, uttering a similar word of thanks .

Han Li uttered a few pleasantries before saying farewell and flying off in an azure streak .

After Han Li disappeared from sight, the large man with a fierce expression muttered, “I heard when Senior Han just arrived at Deep Heaven City, he was only at early Deity Transformation-stage cultivation, but his abilities were on par with a mid-stage cultivator . And ten years ago, he entered mid-stage and his abilities became even more profound . ”

The other black-armored guard said with admiration, “More than just that . I heard that in the decades he spent on his patrol assignment, he killed eight high-grade foreign beings . He can’t be compared to an ordinary dark azure guard . Could it be that ascended cultivators are all such fearsome existences . ”

The middle-aged woman snorted and said, “Ascended cultivators are a grade stronger than those native to the spirit realm, but that Senior Han is an outlier even among ascended cultivators . ”

The other cultivators were startled when they heard this .

After Han Li faded from sight, the old man twirled his beard long in thought . After a short while, he waved his hand and had his squad depart .

Hundreds of kilometers away, an azure streak tore through the air and the light faded away to reveal Han Li .

At that same moment, a dozen streaks of light flew up from the ground and stopped before Han Li to reveal black-armored cultivators .

“Squad Leader!”

“Senior Han!”

They all called out to him and stood at attention while floating in the air .

After several decades had passed, the squad remained safe and sound, but this time, they viewed Han Li with obvious respect . They no longer possessed an ounce of disobedience .

This was to be expected .

The other three squads that undertook patrol missions in similar areas would see an astonishing number of deaths . There were times that over half the small squads would need to be replaced . Although his own squad encountered many dangers, Han Li resolved each of them with ease, earning him the unopposed command of his squad .

Of course, under Han Li’s guidance, the squad acquired many rewards, much to their satisfaction .

Han Li nodded and casually said, “Let’s go, the foreign being was a green shadow and it has already been disposed of . ”

A cultivator with a young appearance chuckled and said, “A green shadow? That is quite troublesome . The squad leader must’ve been able to restrain him easily with his Divine Essensefused Light . Let alone the green shadow, if a scarlet shadow appeared, the squad leader might’ve had a real fight . ”

Han Li snorted and said, “A scarlet shadow is something that even Spatial Tempering cultivators find difficult to deal with . How could I possibly deal with one? Alright, let’s hurry on our way . After we patrol this last area, we’ll be able to rest for another year . Last time, we encountered a high-grade Cave Hollow Tribe being there . This time, we encountered a high-grade Shadow Tribe Being . ”

Cultivator Ma’s cheek twitched and he sullenly said, “That’s right . Isn’t this becoming too ordinary over the past ten years? Even if we commonly discover foreign tribe scouts, it can’t happen this often . There are even high-grade beings among them, each of them entering the swamp without any fear . I heard that the Buried Bone Desert that the demons are managing on the other side are also encountering a large number of foreign tribe scouts . Large number of metamorphosed demons are also dying on their patrols . Could it be there are foreign tribes that plan on attacking Deep Heaven City?”

When the others heard this, their expressions vastly changed and their smiles faded .

Still as beautiful as before, Fairy Xu frowned and said, “That can’t be, it had only been thirty thousand years the foreign tribes last attacked Deep Heaven City . Don’t they usually launch an attack every sixty thousand years?”
