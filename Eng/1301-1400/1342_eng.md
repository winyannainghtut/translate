Chapter 1342: Securing the Scales

In the face of three true spirit scales, tens of millions of spirit stones were nothing but mere numbers . Everyone wanted to make a breakthrough with immediate effect .

After all, it was extremely difficult for Deity Transformation cultivators to progress, and the majority of Deity Transformation cultivators were stuck at the early-Deity Transformation Stage until the day they died .

The scales essentially provided a lifeline, and everyone immediately burst into a frenzy to try and secure the scales for themselves .

However, no matter how desperately one wanted to secure the scales, they had to be conscious of their limits .

After the price rose above 25,000,000 spirit stones, there were almost no cultivators left who were still participating in the bidding .

In fact, there were only three such cultivators left .

One of them was the same one who had just secured the True Toad Spirit Blood, and his voice was still as lazy as ever .

Among the other two voices, one was quite wizened and coarse, while the other was pleasant to the ears . It sounded as if the remaining two cultivators were an elderly man and a young female cultivator respectively .

The bids rolled in at increments of 1,000,000 spirit stones at a time, and the price was quickly approaching 30,000,000 .

When the owner of that lazy voice made an astronomical bid of 30,000,000, the other two cultivators immediately fell silent .

It appeared that this price was already beyond what they were able to afford, so they could only give up .

All of the cultivators looked up in the air above the auction platform . There, the number on the massive disk was slowly changing color . Once it became completely crimson in color, that would mean a final price had been settled .

"31,000,000"

All of a sudden, an unfamiliar voice sounded .

As soon as this bid was made, all of the cultivators in the hall faltered momentarily before immediately turning their attention to the stone cabin that Han Li was situated in .

It appeared that even at such a jaw-dropping price, there were still people willing to make additional bids .

Within the stone cabin, Han Li sat with a calm and collected expression .

"32,000,000"

The lazy voice carried a hint of surprise this time .

"33,000,000"

Han Li immediately placed another bid without any hesitation .

"34,000,000"

This time, the lazy voice only placed the bid after a momentary hesitation .

"35,000,000"

Many of the cultivators present were struggling to pick their jaws up off the ground .

These were true spirit scales on offer here, but surely such a ridiculous price was too much! Even the spirit treasures that ranked at the bottom of the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll were only around this price .

"35,000,000? Hmph! Fellow Daoist Chi, I highly suspect that this fellow Daoist doesn't have that many spirit stones, and is only bidding to cause trouble for me . Shouldn't you be assessing whether he actually has that many spirit stones?" the owner of the lazy voice suddenly said in a cold manner .

"I'll be sure to verify this in person at the conclusion of the auction . However, everything shall progress as normal before then . Please continue, Fellow Daoists," the white-robed elderly man merely replied with a calm smile .

He clearly didn't want to offend either of the bidders before learning their identities .

"If that's the case, then I won't be placing any further bids . I want to see if this fellow Daoist truly can offer something worth 35,000,000 spirit stones as a bond . " The owner of the lazy voice seemed to have grown quite frustrated, and he really did refrain from participating in any further bidding .

Thus, the number on the massive disk turned crimson, and the white-robed elderly man announced Han Li to be the new owner of the three true spirit scales . After that, the white-robed elderly man and the woman carrying the jade box began to fly toward the stone cabin that Han Li was situated in .

Soon, they reached the cabin before stopping .

The elderly man flipped his hand over to produce an azure badge . He waved the badge gently toward the stone cabin before entering the cabin with the female appraiser behind him .

After entering the room, the elderly man appraised Han Li for a brief moment before offering a smile and cupping his fist in a salute .

"Your treasure has been delivered, Fellow Daoist . It's time for you to issue the spirit stones . If you have something you can offer as a bond, Fellow Daoist He here will appraise its value and offer discounts accordingly . If you'd like, I can also invite the other two appraisers here as well . " The white-robed elderly man was speaking in quite a polite manner .

"I trust your discerning eyes, Brother Chi, Fellow Daoist He . Have a look at this . "

Han Li glanced at the jade box being carried by the woman before rustling his sleeve . A small brocade box that had been prepared well in advance emerged from within .

The white-robed elderly man had seen countless treasures in his time, and he merely accepted the box with a calm expression before opening the lid .

A burst of fragrant aroma immediately wafted throughout the entire cabin . The elderly man's calm facade completely crumbled at the sight of the contents of the box . "A myriad year spirit herb!"

The elderly drew a sharp breath before finally tearing his gaze away from the item in the box . He then turned to Han Li with a rather peculiar look in his eyes .

The woman's heart also jolted upon hearing the words "myriad year spirit herb" . She strode over to the elderly man and also peered into the brocade box .

Lying within the box, enshrouded in a ball of white light, was a pristine white spirit herb that was several inches in length . There were runes around it that were flashing like projections . "Myriad year spirit runes! That does indeed appear to be a myriad year spirit herb, but further appraisal will be required to verify its authenticity," the woman said in a slow voice after staring at the spirit herb for a long while .

"That's your area of expertise, Fellow Daoist He, so I'll have to trouble you to appraise this treasure . " The white-robed elderly man was being quite respectful toward the woman .

The woman nodded before accepting the brocade box that was being handed over to her . She then flipped over her other hand, and a thin green jade ruler appeared . The ruler was around a foot in length, and there were over 20 peculiar spiral patterns carved onto its surface .

The woman's eyes flashed as she slowly extended the ruler toward the spirit herb in the box .

Before the green ruler had even come into contact with the spirit herb, white spiritual light erupted amid a low ringing sound . At the same time, the peculiar spiral patterns on the jade ruler lit up one after the other, emanating piercing green light .

After the 11th and final pattern lit up, the woman's calm expression was finally beginning to crack a little .

She carefully examined the spirit herb in the box once again before concluding in a firm voice, "This is indeed a myriad year spirit herb, and it's a Snow Wyrm Herb that's around 11,000 years old . Snow Wyrm Herbs are quite rare, so they're much more valuable than normal myriad year spirit medicines . I value this at around 7,000,000 spirit stones . "

"7,000,000? That's around what I was expecting . Do you have any objections, Fellow Daoist?" The white-robed elderly man nodded before turning to Han Li .

"I'm fine with that price . I also have some more that you can take; they should be enough to pay for the auction item . " Azure light flashed from Han Li's wrist, and four jade boxes appeared, all of which he tossed toward the white-robed elderly man in a calm manner .

The elderly man waved an arm to catch all of the jade boxes before opening them one by one .

He was trying his best to maintain a calm facade on this occasion, but the twitching of his eyelid still betrayed his emotional turmoil .

"Are these all myriad year spirit herbs?" he asked in a slightly hoarse voice .

"Why do you ask? Do you not accept such spirit medicines?" Han Li asked with a smile .

"Of course we do, Fellow Daoist . " the white-robed elderly man chuckled in response, but the shock in his eyes was quite apparent .

The female appraiser was also starting to become rather skeptical .

She appraised the spirit herbs in the jade boxes one by one, following which an incredulous look appeared on her face .

Individual myriad year spirit herbs naturally weren't as precious as true spirit scales . However, they had much more practical applications as they could be used as ingredients to refine a wide range of pills . As such, they were demand always far exceeded supply for these treasures .

Furthermore, they were also extremely valuable, so they were basically the next best currency used on the market, second only to spirit stones . Perhaps shops would reject other items, but there wasn't a single shop that would reject myriad year spirit herbs .

"Seeing as Fellow Daoist He has verified the authenticity of these spirit herbs, then these three true spirit scales belong to you now, Fellow Daoist . " A hint of curiosity flashed through the white-robed elderly man's eyes as he put on a wide smile and handed over the brocade box to Han Li .

"Thank you . " Han Li made a grabbing motion, and the brocade box was drawn toward him . He briefly inspected the contents of the box before nodding with a pleased expression .

The white-robed elderly man was very curious about Han Li had come across so many myriad year spirit herbs, but he didn't articulate those questions . He merely stowed away the spirit herbs before departing from the stone cabin and returning to the auction platform .

Even though the elderly man and the female appraiser had spent quite a while in Han Li's cabin, this amount of time was naturally negligible to the cultivators outside, who would often meditate for months at a time .

However, all of them immediately turned their attention toward the duo as soon as they emerged . Everyone wanted to know whether the transaction had been a success .

"Rest assured, fellow Daoists, the transaction was a success . We'll now be moving on to the next auction item . This is a spirit treasure on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll, so it's even more valuable than true spirit scales . This is the Divine Spirit Treasures, Sea Razing Halberd . Its base price is 20,000,000 spirit stones!" The white-robed elderly man didn't disclose any information about Han Li, immediately moving on to announcing the next auction item instead . The elderly man among the trio of appraisers stepped forward right on cue, producing a shimmering blue short halberd from his spirit bracelet .

The cultivators in the hall were naturally extremely interested in this treasure as well . After the elderly man displayed some of the halberd's incredible abilities, an intense bout of bidding immediately commenced .

At this moment, Han Li's attention was focused entirely on the black scale in his hand, seemingly completely disinterested in the Divine Spirit Treasure being offered outside .

In the end, the short halberd was purchased by an unfamiliar cultivator for the same price of 35,000,000 spirit stones .

It was finally time for the last auction item to be revealed .
