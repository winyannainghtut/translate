“Ah!” Han Li pumped his fist up into the air and cried out with excitement.

At this moment, his childish nature could clearly be seen.

It would appear that his assumption was correct: when windows were sealed, the amount light attracted to the bottle was a small amount. But when in an wide unobstructed area, the amount of light attracted to it was far greater.

But where did these rays of light come from? What use were they? Although he still didn’t know the answer, he was making a long stride towards solving the riddle.

Han Li thought that he would quickly uncover the secret to this bottle, and was excited to see the conclusion.

At dawn, the moment when the sky began to turn bright, the light around the bottle slowly faded.

In this moment, Han Li paid attention to the bottle’s state while continuing to make sure that no one would come in and notice this.

He bent down to pick the bottle and inspected it.

But the bottle wasn’t any different and was still impossible to open.

Han Li had felt disappointed, but seeing how it was getting later in the morning, he put away the bottle, preparing to leave.

After all, he still wanted to return to the stone room to practice cultivation.

For the next following nights at fixed intervals, the bottle would undergo the same experience. Spheres of light would fly towards the bottle like a moth to the flame, and no matter if it was a big speck of light or small, it was greedily devoured by the bottle.

Han Li had figured that the bottle would continue to undergo this phenomenon, but on the 8th day, something new had happened.

As Han Li placed the bottle in its regular spot, it continued to absorb the light when all of a sudden, it had stopped. Suddenly, the dark green designs on the bottle began to emit a green radiance as a golden words manifested on top of the bottle. The strange words on the bottle were imposing and firm, but the written strokes were unusual. The words were reminiscent of an ancient era as they incessantly flickered.

But this weird occurrence had ended soon after as well. Aside from the golden words that were now imprinted onto the bottle, everything else had remained the same.

After seeing so strange things happening with the bottle for the past few days, Han Li was no longer surprised like he was in the past. Even with the golden words appearing on the bottle, he wasn’t shocked.

Casually taking the bottle into his hand, he tried to open the bottle on a whim.

With barely any effort, the lid popped off.

No way! Han Li stared at the bottle with shock.

With such little strength without any thought behind it, the problem he had had regarding the bottle had been suddenly resolved. How could it be so easy to just resolve this matter?

Repeatedly looking down at the bottle to confirm that what he was looking at was true, he tried to calm his heart before looking straight into the inside of the bottle.

Inside the bottle was a dark green drop of liquid that was no bigger than a soybean. As it flowed around inside the bottle, the entire inside of the bottle reflected green.

What was this?

Han Li was disappointed, he had put in so much effort only to be rewarded with some mundane object.

Disappointedly putting the bottle back into his pouch, Han Li turned around and returned to his room. The excitement he had previously was suddenly thrown to the farthest corners of the earth.

Although the bottle had finally been open, he was not satisfied with this result.

Han Li would come back and find out the secrets to this liquid another time. Maybe in the future it would reveal quite the surprise for him!

Right now what he wanted to do most was—go back and sleep. For the past few days, he had not been able to comfortably sleep, which cut into his daytime cultivation efficiency to the point where even Elder Mo had inquired him about it.

Ever since Han Li became the disciple of Elder Mo after breaking through the first layer of the chant, he had felt that there was no longer any need to practice the chant. With the result the chant, or lack thereof, he feel quite dissatisfied and so he was unwilling to continue relying on it to cultivate.

For that, Elder Mo had firmly reprimanded him.

But even when it was time to cultivate, he was still unenthusiastic and without spirit.

At this, Elder Mo had become angry and began to doubt his choice in a disciple.

Thinking about that, Han Li couldn’t help but feel wronged. He was not expecting such forceful behavior from Elder Mo.

But what Han Li couldn’t imagine was that, after waking up on the second day, he was once more motivated and threw his entire body into cultivating madly.

For him to cultivate in such a manner was because of a single, simple statement Elder Mo had made.

“For every single layer you improve with this chant, I will increase the amount of silver issued to you another fold.” Elder Mo had seen the thirst Han Li had for money and so figured out a way for Han Li to be enticed. This way would make Han Li motivated enough to cultivate.

For the next few days, Han Li dedicated himself to cultivate using the chants.

Everyday from morning to noon and noon to night, he would enter the stone cultivation room twice to sit down and cultivate. Any thought about how repetitious, mundane, or boring this lifestyle was was immediately thrown out of Han Li’s head.

For the sake of Han Li’s cultivation, Elder Mo had even temporarily sealed off the Valley of God’s Hand. Even when he looked at the patients he would treat them outside of it and wouldn’t let Han Li worry about anything but the chant.

Even the bottle had been slowly forgotten by Han Li.

Autumn went by as winter came, then spring came before summer arrived.

In a flash, four years had gone by, and Han Li was 14 years old now.

He had grown to be even more tanned and looked like a usually silent village boy. Based on his appearances alone, he looked no different than any other farmer boy his age. His looks did not warrant any attention; he was not extraordinarily handsome, and neither did he have that regal air around him like nobles did.

The was the result of living at the stone cultivation house everyday. He would travel back and from from there to his home while occasionally going to Elder Mo’s residence to learn about medicine and read all sorts of different books. The entire valley was his world to live in, and even his chant had successfully reached the 3rd layer.
