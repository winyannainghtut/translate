# Chapter 1061: Three Treasures United

After such a long wave of furious attacks, Master Sable finally calmed down. After such a long time trapped inside of the devilish Qi, he already knew that Lady Mu’s Nascent Soul was gone.

With Daoist Sevenwonders’ call to attention, Master Sable’s expression turned stern and he flicked his sleeve, summoning an earth-colored block above him.

The brick was made of an otherworldly smooth jade that faintly shined with layers of silver and golden talisman characters. It possessed a huge spiritual Qi that was strangely stable.

“The Mountain Crushing Seal!” A woman’s voice shouted out in astonishment.

Han Li followed the source of the voice and found Lin Yinping looking at the tool in astonishment.

The block was a Divine Spirit Treasure replica that appeared at the underground auction he participated in some time ago.

Although he had left early, he later heard that the treasure was bought at an astronomical sum. He didn’t expect that it had fallen into the hands of the High Zenith Sect. The sect’s wealth was a testament to its position as the greatest sect of the Righteous Dao.

When the Mountain Crushing Seal lit up, Daoist Sevenwonders cackled and soon raised his hand, flicking at the Scarlet Cry Drum that floated in the air.

Then, a muffled thump pounded from the drum.

The small instrument lit up in crimson light and a wheel of red haze began to form around the drum.

Sevenwonders flicked his finger once more when he saw this and the drum let out another thump, having the light flare with increasing brilliance.

A low and methodical drumming fell and the wheel gradually rose into the air like the morning sun, producing an ever rising and fearsome pressure as time went on.

As for the Mountain Crushing Seal, Master Sable had already uttered an incantation and struck the block with spell seals, expanding it into a sixty-meter-tall mountain. Folded layers of spell formations and talisman characters etched on the surface of the jade block. At the same time, the dazzling yellow mist surrounding it seemed to cause worldly Qi to circle it, a testament to its power.

As soon as the treasures appeared, they instantly attracted the attention of the others present. When Long Meng sensed the astonishing pressure the treasures emitted, she raised her brow and glanced at them with an odd expression, then expressionlessly closed her eyes.

The huge wolf’s face blanked for a moment and turned solemn.

A cold glint flashed through the huge wolf’s eyes and she snorted, “You think you can defeat me with just two replicas? You’re dreaming.” Black light focused from its mouth, producing a black sphere of light. It slowly flew out and began to faintly pulse in size.

Soon after, beams of black light rhythmically sank into the sphere and disappeared without a trace.

The orb expanded with exceptional speed and grew to the size of building in the blink of an eye, floating until it was directly above the wolf’s head.

The sphere’s color could only be described as an unending void, inspiring an existential dread in those who saw it.

Even then, the sphere continued to expand.

“Go!” Master Sable’s brows sank and he pointed to the huge seal in the air, taking the lead in launching an attack.

The Mountain Crushing Seal flared with light and streaked towards the altar as a shooting star. The red sun formed from the drum trembled and soon followed suit.

The two glaring lights carried astonishing power. They shredded through the mist of devilish Qi like wet paper.

Even if they were not real Divine Spirit Treasures, when combined to this degree of coordination, their combined might was equivalent to an ordinary strike from a true Divine Spirit Treasure.

The huge wolf released a mist of light into the huge black sphere above her without any hesitation in retaliation.

The black sphere trembled and faintly thrummed, soon shooting forward to meet the attack of the two treasures.

As it flew forward, it consumed all of the devilish Qi it moved past in a display of momentum.

The three masses eventually collided in midair with one another.

The impact rocked the area. Black light, yellow mist, and scarlet radiance exploded, resulting in the spiritual pressure creating a visible wall of energy that split the world in two.

On one side lay a vast emptiness like the starry sky, and the other a glorious bloom of twinkling yellow and red like a galaxy.

Thunderous sounds rumbled from both sides as if countless weapons were clashing against one another. As the confrontation continued, the wall of light was constantly tugging towards either side.

However, this deadlock didn’t last for long. As the huge wolf continued to fuel the black wall with a huge beam of light, it eventually began to push back the two replicas.

Both Master Sable and Daoist Sevenwonders expressions vastly changed.

The two hadn’t expected that the devil would be able to block the attack relying solely on its abilities. As the confrontation continued, the two continued to strike their treasures with spell seals, madly pouring their magic power into them. They glanced at one another — aghast.

Not only were the Devil Restriction Bands completely useless, but their most powerful treasures weren’t able to suppress her either. With the seal on the altar on the verge of being opened, they knew matters were far from good.

While dread beginning to settle in their mind, Han Li suddenly slapped his storage pouch and summoned the Triflame Fan into his hand. He took a deep glance at the wall of light and darkness and sighed. With a mental command, he had his human-like puppet relocate behind him, still remaining in concealment.

Then, he slapped his hands together, causing the fan to surge in size, quickly growing ten-meters-large in the blink of an eye. He knew it was foolish to meet the devil ancestor head-on, but he also knew that if Sable and Sevenwonders were defeated, he would be next to the block.

With a series of phoenix cries, a tri-color blaze roared from the fan. He was going to make use of the fan’s full potential.

This was a crucial moment and he couldn’t afford to hold any of his magic power in reserve.

Activated, the Triflame Fan emitted an astonishing spiritual pressure, immediately drawing the attention of Master Sable and Sevenwonders. When Master Sable saw the fan in his hand, he cried out, “Fellow Daoist! That’s...”

Han Li had no interest in wasting his breath and simply shook the fan. Suddenly, tri-colored flame violently rushed out and condensed into a fifteen-meter-long bird. It let out a shriek, unfolded its wings, and dived straight towards the light wall.

Under the astonished gaze of the two grand cultivators, the bird erupted into a halo of light, producing a wave of large gold and silver talisman characters soaring through the air. Then, the halo of light disappeared in a flash.

The red and yellow light suddenly surged, followed by the appearance of gold and silver flames in their ranks. They immediately gained the upper hand and began to gradually push back the black wall with an unyielding force.

The Silver-winged Nightfiend, Lin Yinping, and the others had already seen Han Li use the Triflame Fan in some capacity, but Corpse Xiong and Long Meng hadn’t and both looked at Han Li with shock.

Master Sable and Sevenwonders were delighted by this surprise. Although they didn’t know how he came across a spirit treasure replica, its power was no less than that of the Mountain Crushing Seal and the Scarlet Cry Drum. The two acted without any further thought and hastily controlled their treasures to flare with even greater power, preparing to make use of this new opportunity to deal with the devil incarnation in a single blow.

After releasing the full-powered strike, Han Li’s complexion had turned bloodlessly pale. He immediately summoned a jade bottle into his hand and downed a drop of spirit milk, instantly replenishing his exhausted magic power.

Just as he finished, he suddenly heard the wretched howl of a wolf. His heart trembled and he hastily raised his head.

He saw a black light enveloping both the altar and the wolf, preventing anyone from seeing what was happening.

Han Li frowned. Blue light flickered from his eyes, but he still was blind against it.

Suddenly, Han Li sensed something flicker from the blackness. Within the exact same interval of time, his barrier shook and a cold light ruptured from it.

There was no opportunity to respond.

‘Not good!’ Han Li’s heart sank, and he soon heard a clear explosion, followed by several booms.

His body trembled before he was sent flying.

“Yi!” A surprised yelped sounded from the altar, followed by a cold snort. Something flickered from it once more.

“Dodge! That’s the Heavenwolf Drill!” Silvermoon shouted in panic.

At that same moment, a silhouette flashed in front of him.

Several muffled thumps sounded out and the silhouette was knocked several steps back. Piercing through the human-like puppet’s robes was a strangely-curved shard stabbing into its stomach.
