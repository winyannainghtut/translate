Chapter 1092: Frigid Soulfreeze Formation

A layer of purple flames lit up from Han Li’s body, blocking the icy winds from approaching him .

The winds seemed to melt away as soon as they touched him .

At that same moment, Han Li glanced to the side . The entire hall was covered in ice, but the users of the ice flames were completely unharmed .

Bai Mengxin protected herself with white flames while Arctic Dragon emitted a cloud of Celestial Ice Flames from the small cauldron in front of him .

As for the middle-aged azure-robed man, a black flame enveloped his as he held his hands behind his back .

The old woman produced a yellow walking cane at an unknown time, creating clouds of yellow flame in front of her .

The grey-robed monk slapped his hands together, producing a green flame that coiled around his body, flickering as it blocked the icy winds .

As for the other cultivators, they were able to block the icy winds, but their barriers and treasures flickered in their struggle against the winds .

In the blink of an eye, the howling came to a sudden stop and winds gradually dispersed, filling the entire hall with silence .

As Han Li’s eyes wandered, he formed a hand incantation and his purple flames were absorbed back into his body .

He looked at the stone gate and found countless giant pillars of ice erected there almost like a maze .

His heart stirred and he released his spiritual sense forward . Not long after, he felt his spiritual sense become sluggish and heavy, a sign that peculiar spirit restrictions laid within .

The old woman and the others sensed the same and their expressions changed .

Arctic Dragon took a deep breath and turned to gravely look at the foreign cultivators . “Fellow Daoists, be careful! This is also the first time that I’ve entered the Spirit Void Hall . Although most of the restrictions are under my control, there are a few that even I can’t touch . Please follow me with the utmost care to avoid triggering any of the restrictions . ”

The old woman indifferently replied, “Of course . Why would we recklessly rush through your palace’s restricted area?”

Han Li and the grey-robed monk raised no objections .

Arctic Dragon nodded with satisfaction and announced to the North Night Palace elders, “The process of breaking the bottleneck will take a month at worse, less than a week at best . If those demons attack the palace during this time, respond in accordance to our original plans . If there are any unforeseen events and I’ve yet to emerge for two months, put our reserve plans into action!”

“Yes, Grand Elder!” The group of cultivators replied with a solemn tone .

“Then we shall be heading in!” Arctic Dragon then turned around and summoned a fist-sized jade plate into his hand with a wave of his sleeve . He then raised the magic tool in his hand and led the way through the stone gate .

Han Li and the other wielders of the ice flames closely followed after him .

Once all of them entered, Arctic Dragon cast a spell seal with a single hand and struck the plate with a spell seal . Soon after, the stone gates closed with a rumble and talisman characters lit back up from it .

When the old woman and the grey-robed monk saw this, they exchanged an odd glance .

“Fellow Daoists, don’t worry,” Arctic Dragon explained, “Although the gates are difficult to open from the outside, it is easy from the interior . For the time being, I’ve shut it to prevent anyone from bothering us . ”

The old woman and the monk found it difficult to speak against this . As for Han Li, he didn’t seem to mind this at all .

When the group walked thirty meters forward, they arrived in front of many ice pillars and were dazzled by the shiny sight .

Arctic Dragon calmly warned, “These pillars of Myriad Year Profound Ice have all gone through tempering by ancient cultivators to form the Frigid Soulfreeze Formation . Those without the suitable magic tool would instantly freeze upon entering . The icy winds we encountered from the entrance was the icy Qi that accumulated from the formation after being sealed for a thousand years . Even wielders of glacial flames would find it difficult to survive the formation . ”

When the old lady and the monk heard this, they glanced at the pillars of eyes with traces of doubt .

Han Li chuckled, “Fellow Daoist Arctic Dragon, don’t worry . We aren’t interested in testing the might of the formation . ”

Arctic Dragon smiled when he heard this and he began to wave the formation plate in his hand towards the endless mass of ice pillars in front of him .

Suddenly, a beam of white light shot out from the plate and left white light from places it crossed . White light then lit up from the pillars of ice, creating the illusion of a passage .

With white light continuing to shine from the formation plate, Arctic Dragon walked forward .

The party closely stuck close behind him .

Han Li walked at the group's rear, looking around him curiously .

The pillars of profound ice were remarkable thick, appearing as if two people could hug around them, and had a sleep surface .

Upon closer inspection, dim talisman characters were roaming across the surface of the pillars . When he through to examine them closer, the talisman characters suddenly disappeared . It was truly mysterious .

When he raised his head, he noticed a dense icy mist about two hundred meters above them . They obscured the top half of the ice pillars from view .

But it was obvious these ice pillars contained a fearsome amount of cold energy . Even a distance of ten meters away, one could sense the treads of glacial Qi they emitted . Although they couldn't compare to flames of extreme cold, they were beyond what ordinary cold Qi was capable of .

It was no wonder why Arctic Dragon was so confident!

As Han Li pondered, the party ventured for about a kilometer . Throughout their journey, the pillars of ice lined up densely to either side .

Despite the party’s calm appearance, this came as a shock to them .

After walking for the time it would take to finish a cup of tea, light had finally opened around them and they walked out from the pillars of ice . There was a raised altar in front of them; it was sixty meters tall and over three hundred meters tall .

It was made from of white jade and was covered in blue light . Faint golden doors could be seen from its side, each over twenty meters tall with ancient talismans embedded on each side . They appeared to be a sealed passage of some sort .

When Arctic Dragon saw this, he wore an expression of joy and he put away the formation plate in his hand . He took large strides towards the altar and raised his hands . With blue sparks, a layer of Celestial Ice Flames wrapped around them, then pressing his hands against the altar .

The flames and the altar’s light barrier fused, causing the barrier to slightly tremble . It burst with blinding light as the barrier became translucent; followed by a strange bang, it turned to crystal and cracked from where Arctic Dragon infused the flames, then vanishing in nearly an instant .

Arctic Dragon’s figure suddenly blurred and he stood on top of the altar .

Han Li and company turned to streaks of light and arrived at Arctic Dragon’s side .

At that moment, Arctic Dragon held his hands behind his back and looked down at the ground in front of him .

Han Li followed his gaze, soon discovering there was a strange spell formation located at the center of the altar . Furthermore, there was also a huge pattern at the center that looked the same as the Heavenvoid Cauldron .

For just a moment, Han Li’s face betrayed a change of expression .

Arctic Dragon’s unintentionally brushed past Han Li . Although his face was now ordinarily calm, Arctic Dragon still focused his gaze on him and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han, have you seen a spell formation of this kind before?”

Han Li’s heart jumped and he slowly replied, “Yes, I had seen something like this in an ancient cave residence, but upon closer inspection, I see that it is truly different . It was only a lapse in judgment .

“Is that so?” Arctic Dragon wore a mysterious smile . It may have been a display of doubt, but he didn’t pursue the matter . Instead, he swept his sleeve, releasing a small cauldron that lit up with Celestial Ice Flames . It spun through the air until it arrived above the spell formation .

Han Li pursed his lips and unconsciously gasped . The others’ attention was fully captured by what was happening .

With one of his hands forming a gesture, he flicked his other hand towards the small cauldron .

A muffled bang sounded out as the small cauldron grew larger . Blue flames violently lit up from the cauldron, instantly covering every inch of its surface, restoring the cauldron to its original size .

At that moment, Bai Mengxin and the azure-robed middle-aged man both took a step forward and raised their hand, producing a white and black flame that struck two sides of the formation .

Suddenly, a huge rumble shook the ground and the spell formation lit up, activated by the two flames . The huge cauldron pattern at the center shined dazzlingly . Lightly slowly emerged from it to take the form of a cauldron of blue light .

The original cauldron had stayed floating above the formation this entire time . When the phantom cauldron fully emerged, Arctic Dragon controlled it to immediately drop down . Blue light wildly flashed as they began to fuse together . As a huge explosion boomed, the cauldron

Arctic Dragon suddenly muttered a strange incantation and the Celestial Ice flames spurt forth from the cauldron like a volcano, enveloping the entire spell formation .

When the formation and the flames made contact, blindingly light flashed and the entire altar began to violently shake .

With the cauldron at the center, cracks began to appear on the ground, gradually widening and expanding as time went on .

While Han Li and company floated in the air, they looked down with awe .

The huge cauldron was now suspended in the air at its original location . White beams of light faintly shined from underneath the cracks around it .
