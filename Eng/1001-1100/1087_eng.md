Chapter 1087: Ice Rage Beasts

“This is the lair of the Ice Rage Beasts?” Han Li glanced down at an unfathomably deep ravine in the ice and frowned . Biting glacial winds blew out from it without end .

Bai Yaoyi floated at Han Li’s side and looked around them . Then she confidently said, “That’s right, this is the place!”

“In that case, let’s have them come out!” Han Li nodded and formed a spell seal . His entire body flickered with light and specks of starlight emerged in front of him . Then with a crackle, they burst into scarlet fist-sized fireballs .

“Go!”

With a sweep of his sleeve, a wall of flame enveloped the fireballs and launched them into the ravine, soon disappearing from sight .

Han Li and Bai Yaoyi proceeded to stare down with complete focus .

A long while later, silence still filled the ravine . The sounds resulting from the fireballs’ eruption never occurred .

Han Li and Bai Yaoyi looked at each other with an odd expression .

Han Li stroked his chin and said, “They are only grade-six demon beasts . They shouldn’t be able to silently destroy the fireballs . It seems there is a more formidable beast down there . ”

Bai Yaoyi wore a solemn expression, “It is possible! The disciple hadn’t tread deep into the ravine . They only saw the Profound Ice Flower from a distance before being discovered by the Ice Rage Beasts . ”

“Hehe, that’s fine . I’ll just use my spirit beasts to draw them out,” Han Li said with an indifferent tone . He slapped his storage pouch and summoned a dozen white streaks that circled once around him . They were foot-long Six-winged Frost Centipedes, each possessing translucent wings and a fiendish appearance .

Han Li let out a low cry and pointed at the Six-winged Frost Centipedes in the air . The centipedes buzzed with joy and wrapped themselves in glacial light as they dived down .

Bai Yaoyi betrayed surprise, but she said nothing .

Han Li had no concern for the Six-winged Frost Centipedes . Even a grade-eight demon beast wouldn’t be able to escape them if they launched a joint attack .

And not long after, the sounds of battle echoed from the ravine, drawing closer, turning louder before the battle was dragged outside .

Han Li pursed his lips and silently waved his sleeve, releasing a dozen golden streaks from his sleeve . They turned into a dozen foot-long golden swords, floating still above the ice reveal as they sparkled with light .

Bai Yaoyi smiled, believing Han Li would be able to deal with the demon beasts with ease .

A short moment later, a series of monstrous roars sounded from below . Afterwards, a series of white mist blew out from them, containing eight snow-white lion-like beasts . They appeared extremely frightened as if they were fleeing for their lives .

They were the so-called Snow Rage Beasts .

He launched a sword seal without any hesitation, causing several of his swords to tremble and launch themselves forward, turning into dazzling three-meter-long streaks .

Like a flash of lightning, they slashed across the white mist and arrived before the beasts .

Before they could even respond, the swordstreaks coiled around them .

With several miserable screams, the beasts were cleaved into two and their corpses sank back into the pit .

Soonafter , a world-shaking roar rumbled from the ground, followed by a huge explosion . A dense wind shot out from the ravine’s depths .

Han Li narrowed his eyes and saw an enraged ten-meter-tall demon beast .

It appeared mostly the same as the Ice Rage Beasts, but its fur glistened with silver light and its body was an entire size larger .

“Yi! That isn’t a Snow Rage Beast . That’s an Ice Fiend!” Bai Yaoyi yelped in shock . “What is such a high-grade demon beast doing here?”

Han Li blinked and took no further action . A dozen white streaks then flew out from the ravine and spat icy Qi at the silver-furred beast .

Although the demon beast was only a grade-seven demon beast, it had no fear of the Six-winged Frost Centipedes’s attack . Rather, the attack only served to incite it further .

Han Li raised his brow and coldly snorted . He extended his finger and azure light flickered from its tip, commanding the flying swords above him to strike at the beast .

At the side, Bai Yaoyi suddenly said, “Please wait a moment! The Ice Fiend is a rare ice and wind attributed demon beast . It will be useful if I can capture it . ”

Han Li gave her an easy smile . “In that case, I’ll handle it and save you the trouble!”

With that said, he spat out a ball of purple flames . Then, the flames let out a chirp, shaped into a lifelike foot-wide bird before fluttering towards the Ice Fiend .

When the dozen Six-winged Frost Centipedes saw the bird approach, they immediately scattered in fear, leaving the Ice Fiend alone in the vicinity .

Although the Ice Fiend still hadn’t gained higher awareness, it still possessed a trace of intelligence . Under these circumstances, it could tell the purple flame bird was fearsome and immediately swept up wind, intending to escape .

Han Li let out a cold snort and a light glinted from his eye .

The beast immediately needles assailing its mind and it let out a howl as it fell from the air .

Han Li launched at attack with his spiritual sense, using the Soulfright Thorn .

Although Han Li hadn’t used the full strength of this attack, his spiritual sense was still equivalent in strength to a late-Nascent Soul cultivator . It wasn’t an attack that it could withstand .

With the opportunity given, the purple flame bird arrived in front of the beast and circled it .

As a large crackle sounded, a large ball of purple mist surrounded the Ice Fiend and enveloped the

The purple flame bird immediately unfolded its wings and disappeared into Han Li’s body .

After the purple mist of light disappeared, a thirty-meter-tall black of purple ice was revealed, sealing the Ice Fiend within it . The storm surrounding the beast had slowly disappeared as well and the block of ice shortly crashed to the ground .

To the side, Bai Yaoyi came to her senses after being stunned by the entire affair . She summoned a large hand of white Qi to lift the ice to her .

“Many thanks, Brother Han! I’ll take you up on your offer!” Bai Yaoyi sweetly smiled at Han Li and she flicked her ringer, producing a sparkling black spirit beast pouch .

She tossed the bag into the air and a mist flew out from it, wrapping around the huge block of ice and drawing into the pouch .

Seeing Bai Yaoyi’s satisfied expression, Han Li smiled and pointed to the Six-winged Frost Centipedes circling in the air . With a series of hisses, the centipedes let out balls of icy mist and instantly disappeared .

Bai Yaoyi was startled by the sight of this, but Han Li soon explained, “While I use the Profound Ice Flower to refine medicine, I don’t want any low-grade demon beasts to disturb us . The centipedes will be protecting us nearby . "

Bai Yaoyi sweetly smiled and nodded .

The two soon flew down the huge ravine in streaks of light .

The ravine was pitch-black . Apart from icy winds continuously circling the two, it was reminiscent of the two entering the Yin Yang Cave over ten years ago .

But when they quickly arrived at the bottom, the crystalline walls of the ravine could be seen . They were formed from profound ice, suitable materials for ice-attributed magic tools . However, only myriad year profound ice could be considered a rare, top-grade tool refinement material .

Ordinary profound ice was beneath the notice of the two Nascent Soul cultivators .

But when the two arrived at the very end of the ravine, they spotted a crystal vein that emitted a white light . Although it was jagged, there was a point on it that was clearly myriad year Profound Ice .

Han Li’s eyes then focused on the three white flowers on the wall .

These small flowers were only the size of a fist and appeared to be common wildflowers . But their roots were dug into the myriad year profound ice and faint icy Qi continuously roamed around it .

“Three Profound Ice Flowers . This should be enough,” Han Li muttered .

“There is quite a bit of myriad year profound ice here . It appears that disciple made quite an accomplishment . I’ll have to make sure he is rewarded . ” Bai Yaoyi examined the profound ice and wore a smile .

Han Li then turned to Bai Yaoyi and said, “I will be plucking the flowers immediately for pill concoction . I’ve already prepared the other materials . Will Fairy Bai be returning first?”

With some thought, she said with a warm tone, “How long will Brother Han need to refine the pills . Would it be better for me to take a look at our surroundings? We aren’t far from North Night Valley . With the appearance of the grade-seven Ice Fiend, I feel somewhat ill at ease . I’ll be taking this opportunity to look around . ”

After a short pause, Han Li gave a word of warning, “That would be good . Be careful!”

“Don’t worry, I’m only doing this in case of contingencies . The grade seven Ice Fiend most likely came into the ravine unintentionally . This hadn’t happened before . I’ll be taking off!” Bai Yaoyi pursed her lips into a bewitching smile and streaked into the air .
