When the Fu Clan Ancestor flew out of scope of the Fu Clan Castle, he heard woman’s soft voice speak, “Your earth movement technique is truly slow . How about you hand over your head and allow me to report back to Master?”

The Fu Clan Ancestor was greatly shocked and couldn’t help but stop . In a white blur, a gorgeous beauty appeared before him . She stood only a meter before him and faced him with an enchanting smile .

“You . . . ” Just as the Fu Clan Ancestor was about to cry out in alarm, the woman parted her sweet lips and blew out a pink fragrance mist, enveloping the vulnerable Fu Clan Ancestor in an instant .

The Fu Clan Ancestor inwardly cursed . He hastily attempted to cast a spell and flee, but the sweet scent made rendered his body lax and powerless . Before he could do anything to defend himself, he fell unconscious .

When Silvermoon saw that her prey had fallen unconscious, she faintly smiled and casually waved her hand, sending a white crescent streak towards his neck .

Blood splattered .

. . .

Inside the large hall of the Fu Clan Castle there were several hundred guests that were festively chatting . Several Core Formation cultivators that had personally come to pay their respects were kept company by a few of the higher grade cultivators in the Fu Clan . Friendly relations flourished between the guests and hosts .

But suddenly, there were several screams of anguish that could be faintly heard from outside the hall . The bustling voices in the hall came to an abrupt stop, and many guests looked at each other in dismay . A few of the more quick-witted cultivators immediately turned their gazes onto the Fu Clan cultivators .

The blue-robed old man sitting at the side of the two Devilflame Sect enforcers also appeared shocked, but soon, he wore a calm expression and loudly shouted, “Everyone, please do not worry . It is possible it is but a small matter . I will call over someone and see what’s going on . ” He was the younger cousin of the Fu Clan Ancestor and was the third Fu Clan Core Formation cultivator .

At that moment, he excused himself from the company of the two Devilflame Sect enforcers and turned to the two Fu Clan cultivators standing behind him . He immediately gave them orders to quickly rush out the hall and report back .

The two Devilflame Core Formation cultivators both appeared calm, but they glanced at each other with a trace of doubt .

Two more miserable screams came from the outside . It was clear that the two Fu Clan cultivators that were sent outside had met a vicious attack . The guests in the hall had clearly heard this, and their expressions vastly changed .

The blue-robed old man’s expression grew unsightly and he deeply sighed before standing up . He said with a deep voice, “Activate the hall’s restrictions and quickly send word to the Ancestor . ”

When a nearby Fu Clan cultivator heard this, he acknowledged the order with a pale complexion . He then took out a sound transmission talisman from his robes and whispered a few words before releasing it .

The talisman shot out from the roof in a streak of red light, but a moment later, the cultivator spoke with a raspy voice, “Not good! The sound transmission talisman was shot down . We seem to be surrounded . ”

When this was said, even the Core Formation guests couldn’t remain calm .

The pockmarked Devilflame Sect Enforcer frowned and said, “Fellow Daoist Fu, it seems enemies have snuck into your castle . Brother Sun and I will go out with you and have a look . ”

The blue-robed old man’s anxiousness was greatly relieved upon hearing him . He immediately rejoiced and said, “I am greatly thankful for your assistance . I will have to trouble you to do so . ”

The middle-aged man surnamed Sun frowned as if disapproving of his companion’s actions, but he followed him nevertheless .

As for the remaining four Core Formation cultivators in the hall, they glanced at each other and didn’t reveal the slightest intent to help . The others in the hall grew completely silent, watching the three Core Formation cultivators walk out from the hall .

As the three calmly approached the hall door, loud buzzing suddenly came from outside the hall . The three couldn’t help but halt their steps upon hearing this .

In the blink of an eye, a thirty-meter-long beam of azure light swept inside and wrapped around the three Core Formation cultivators . A dozen lines of fine azure light then shot out from the azure beam in a display of blinding brilliance, forcing the cultivators in the hall to momentarily close their eyes . In that instant, the azure beam spiralled throughout the hall .

The blue-clothed old man and the two Devilflame Sect cultivators halted and their bodies grew motionless as if from shock . As the cultivators in the hall were stunned in their awe, they were completely oblivious to what was happening .

The sudden shriek of a female cultivator attracted the attention of all in the room .

The paled female cultivator was sitting at the side of a Fu Clan steward whose head had tumbled down at an unknown time . The headless corpse was still sitting upright as blood sprayed from its severed neck .

The other cultivators then discovered that tens of Fu Clan cultivators, regardless of their rank, had their heads tumbling onto the ground in a silent death .

“The azure light! Someone is using a magic treasure to attack them! Fellow Daoist Fu, you must . . . ” A cultivator who had decent relations to the Fu Clan loudly shouted in alarm as if to warn the three Core Formation cultivators, but soon, his words came to a sudden stop and his face became ashen .

At that moment, the blue-robed old man and company suddenly split into pieces as if they were made of paper . Their bodies had collapsed into piles of gore .

When this occurred, the guests of the birthday celebration felt their breath turn cold . Although these cultivators were able to somewhat keep their calm previously, they were now in a complete panic . Each of them enveloped themselves in a colorful barrier and filled the room with the bright glow of various colored lights . Magic tools of all sorts began to float in front of many cultivators . Even a few of the cultivators who held more than friendly relations to the Fu Clan gathered together restlessly with terrified expressions .

For three Core Formation cultivators and tens of Fu Clan disciples to be killed in the instant, how could it be anything else apart from the fearful existence known as a Nascent Soul cultivator! If it was truly a Nascent Soul cultivator, killing everyone else in the hall should be an extremely easy matter .

As fear filled the hearts of those present, none dared to make any noise . Many guests presently felt vast regret for attending this Fu Clan celebration . Wouldn’t they be caught in the crossfire?

Deathly silence filled the hall .

A few of the Core Formation cultivators with stronger spiritual senses thought to stealthily release their spiritual sense to observe the outside . However, the Fu Clan had placed down many spiritual sense restrictions in order to protect their secrets from prying eyes . As a result, they were blocked and couldn’t help but resentfully curse the Fu Clan .

As anxiousness filled the hall, the voice of an unfamiliar man spoke, “Those present are restricted from leaving this hall for two hours . Those who disobey will be killed! After those two hours are over, you may leave as you wish . ”

The man’s voice was simple and cold, but it also carried an indescribable malice, shaking the hearts of those who heard it . Once those words were said, the cultivators in the room were greatly relieved . From his tone, it appeared that he had no intention of killing them .

However, they clearly understood that they were spared most likely because they hadn’t seen the man’s true appearance . As such, none dared to disobey him . As for taking revenge for the Fu Clan, the thought itself was a joke . Even if one had the capability, who would feud with a Nascent Soul cultivator over the mere Fu Clan?

The two hours passed by neither fast nor slowly .

During this time apart from a few whispers, screams of anguish occasionally came from the outside . They were curt and lasted only a moment . It was clear none in the Fu Clan castle was able to retaliate as they were killed .

The cultivators in the hall felt their heart tremble upon hearing these screams . Each of them guessed that the Fu Clan had offended an expert or great power and was being exterminated as a result . There were many in the hall that felt schadenfreude or pity for them .

After the time it took to finish the cup of tea, the screams in the Fu Castle had ceased and the outside became as silent as within the hall . The guests then glanced at one another but none of them dared to act rashly .

Once the two hours had passed, the man’s voice didn’t return . In the end, one of the braver Core Formation cultivators decided to leave the hall and he safely left .

In the following moment, the other guests began to rush out with relief .
