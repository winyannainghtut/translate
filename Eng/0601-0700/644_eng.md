Silvermoon widely opened her eyes and she hesitantly said, “Master, you . . . you’re serious?”

“You’ll come to know whether or not my words hold true . For now, call that woman in for me . At her current cultivation, she shouldn’t be able to see through your human form . ” Han Li casually commanded .

Regardless of her suspicions, she respectfully replied, “As you bid, Master!” Han Li then turned around and entered the large hall .

After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Silvermoon gracefully entered the hall with a haggard Mu Peiling . It seemed that this short time had been quite stressful for her .

Silvermoon glanced at Han Li and respectfully said, “Master, Young Lady Mu has arrived . ”

Han Li nodded his head and indifferently said, “I am aware . You may leave . ”

“This servant is excused!” Silvermoon shot a glance at Mu Peiling and departed from hall with a pursed smile .

“I pay my respects to Senior Han . ” After saluting Han Li, she remained helplessly silent as if she were awaiting punishment from Han Li .

Han Li slightly frowned in response to her appearance and he examined her beautiful face .

Without revealing the slightest anger, he calmly said, “You should know why I’ve called you in . You blurted out words to those cultivation clans that gave them a domineering impression of me . After all, seizing an engaged woman as a concubine can’t be something that is easily taken . Of course at my current cultivation, the Mu and Yan Clan wouldn’t dare to complain, nor do I hold them in much esteem . However, this doesn't mean that I will tolerate your presumptuous actions . You should realize I will punish you . ”

The woman raised her head and spoke with a pale complexion, “Please forgive me Senior . This woman has truly been reckless . But rather than wed into the Yan Clan, Junior would find it preferable to become Senior’s concubine . ”

Han Li’s gaze flickered and he snorted before slowly continuing, “Since you said that you were to be my concubine, I can no longer stay uninvolved, nor can I make clear that this is untrue . Otherwise, these cultivation clans will recognize me, this new Drifting Cloud Sect Elder, to be weak and feeble, incapable of protecting even a Foundation Establishment woman underneath him . And these rumors should’ve already spread throughout the cultivation world as well . So tell me, how should I deal with you?”

Mu Peiling bit her lips and softly said, “Junior has nothing to say . I will have no complaints in how Senior will punish me . ”

“Since cultivators on the outside know you to be my concubine, I will give you two choices . The first is to pretend to be my concubine, but you will actually be my servant and obey my orders . After you’ve served me for twenty years, the matter should’ve faded and I will let you free . However, you had best avoid any thoughts that I will assist with the cultivation of a servant girl . ”

When Mu Peiling heard this, she revealed a trace of disappointment and raised her head, asking, “Then, what is the second choice?”

Han Li stared at the woman and calmly said, “The second option is make this fiction a reality, to become my concubine in truth . You will attend to me through your life . I will not treat my own spouse pettily and will guide you in your cultivation if my mood is willing . However, I must first tell you that if you wish to become my concubine, I will place a soul restriction on you to prevent any possible betrayal . After all, if you were to suddenly changed your mind, my secrets could possibly be laid bare . ”

“I . . . ” Mu Peiling grew distracted upon hearing him and her expression fluttered as if she were deeply considering Han Li’s thoughts . It seems this woman didn’t greatly oppose the thought of marrying Han Li .

Han Li indifferently said, “I know that you’ve always been proud . Even a Nascent Soul cultivator such as myself isn’t your ideal husband . However, this doesn’t matter . Fellow Daoist Mu isn’t my ideal Dao companion either, but this won’t stop me from taking you in as a concubine . If you obtain my protection, you will tread farther on the path of cultivation without much cost .

And in these past few years, you’ve come to know that I’m not a brutal or craven eccentric . Even if I place down a restriction on your soul, I won’t mistreat you or cause you hardship . And later on, I may even grow to trust you and remove those restrictions . It either will be this, or acting as my servant for twenty years! Those years as a servant shouldn’t pass by too slowly . ” His eyes moved away from her as if he didn’t mind what she chose .

Mu Peiling’s heart grew turbulent . While she was unwilling to be controlled by another, the assistance and guidance of a Nascent Soul cultivator was also hard to pass . Unable to come to a decision, she hesitantly said, “Senior, could I have two days to consider this?”

As for becoming Han Li’s concubine, she already knew what Han Li had described; it couldn’t be said to be a bad decision in the slightest . Countless beautiful, young Foundation Establishment women would be tempted to take the offer of becoming the concubine of a Nascent Soul cultivator .

Without any intention of making it difficult for her, Han Li leniently nodded his head, “You may . Come back after two days with your answer . It should be enough time for you to come to a decision . ” He then called for Silvermoon to take her out .

After saluting, Mu Peiling followed Silvermoon’s lead and absentmindedly left the hall .

A short moment later, Silvermoon gracefully walked back inside .

Silvermoon’s bright eyes flickered and she mysteriously smiled, “Master, the two conditions you raised are somewhat . . . ”

Han Li glanced at Silvermoon and said, “What? Do you think they’re too harsh? Don’t they align with her wishes?”

Silvermoon sighed and softly said, “It isn’t about harshness . It’s merely that this woman possesses an unyielding heart . With her pride, it would be difficult for her to choose either option . But if Master truly accepts this girl, then a soul restriction is undoubtedly necessary considering his many secrets . ”

Han Li attentively took measure of Silvermoon and spoke with slight surprise, “You seem to have quite a favorable impression of her . ”

Silvermoon was momentarily surprised before wryly smiling, “That isn’t it . It’s just that her staunch character gives me a familiar feeling . It seemed in the past that I had a close relationship to someone with a similar nature . I’ve unconsciously grown concerned with her . ”

Han Li nodded his head and didn’t pursue the matter any further .

Silvermoon tactfully avoided mentioning Mu Peiling and instead discussed the matter of refining the Celestial Ice Flames, Han Li’s most pressing matter .

Two days later, Mu Peiling arrived once more and she was led into the main hall by Silvermoon .

Han Li glanced at the woman and bluntly asked, “So, you should’ve already came to a decision . Will you be my servant for twenty years or will I be placing a soul restriction on you?”

It was the clear the woman had made up her mind . She took a quick breath and calmly said, “I’ve already decided . In the cultivation world, it could be considered destiny for a low grade female cultivator to be given an opportunity to become the concubine of a Nascent Soul cultivator . However, I hope Senior will make a promise before I become his concubine . So long as this condition is met, I am willing to be be restricted by your spiritual sense and spend the rest of my life under you . ”

“A condition? Go ahead and speak . ” Han Li’s face remained unchanged as if he had already anticipated this .

“I know Senior Han isn’t a hasty character . As such, I hope that Senior will pledge to hold off for thirty years before he takes my vital yin . I am currently at a crucial point in my cultivation and wish to see whether or not I can form a core within thirty years . It is extremely important for my cultivation art that I remain a virgin . It was for this reason that I was unwilling to be married . Regardless of whether or not I form my core within this time, Senior may pair cultivate with me once time has passed . ” Perhaps thinking that the conditions were too harsh or that speaking of the matter of pair cultivation was embarrassing, her face blushed after this was all said, revealing a captivating expression .

“Thirty years? Haha! That’s fine . I can agree to your condition . ” Once Han Li heard this, his eyes brightly flickered and he instantly agreed .

Mu Peiling was amazed that Han Li had so quickly agreed, but she soon recovered and joyfully said, “Many thanks to Senior!”

After pondering for a moment, Han Li said, “In two days, I will officially notify the other two elders of the sect that I’ve taken you in as a concubine . But since it will be thirty years before we actually pair cultivate, I will open a smaller separate cave residence for your cultivation among one of the other three mountains . Of course if I have the time, I will go over and give you some guidance . ”

“Yes, as you wish . ” Mu Peiling was clearly very satisfied with these results and approved without thought .

Han Li’s expression relaxed and he mysteriously smiled, “As my future concubine, there is no need to always address me as Senior . You may just call me Sir . I am only two hundred years old, and am quite young considering my lifespan is now over a thousand years . ” Han Li then sized up the beautiful woman without any restraint, clearly appreciating the view .
