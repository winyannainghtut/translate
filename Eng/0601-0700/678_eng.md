“It’s right here . Fellow Daoists, let’s go in . ” The Child Fire Dragon smiled at the two and walked towards the Crystal Dragon Pavilion with a swagger .

Once they approached the pavilion’s large gate, Han Li casually took a look inside and revealed surprise . The interior appeared to be that of an ordinary restaurant . Not only was it full of guests that were eating and drinking, there were also several waiters that were scurrying between tables with dishes in hand . The scents of fine wine and food were accompanied with the clanging of cups .

After they pushed open the gates, they saw a foot long wooden plate hung at the side . ‘This building is taken, outsiders are prohibited’ were written on it in pitch-black words .

“That old ghost Heavencrystal is still playing around with silly illusion techniques . Really!” After muttering those words, the Child Fire Dragon paid no more attention to it and walked in with a stride .

When Han Li heard this, his heart stirred and he swept his spiritual sense past the floor . He soon revealed a strange expression, but he continued inside . Once they passed the gate, the guests, waiters, scents and sounds, all disappeared like the pop of a bubble .

Han Li casually swept his gaze at the scene and saw that all that remained was a grey mist surrounding the building . There was merely an old-fashioned table at the center of the room with a copper lamp that was lit with a grey-robed Daoist with an amiable face sitting behind the lamp . He appeared to be sixty years of age and was glancing at the three with a smile .

“I didn’t expect that Brother Lan would arrive, let alone bring guests . This old Daoist’s eyes are rather poor . It seems as if I’ve never seen this azure-robed Fellow daoist before . Could he have recently entered Nascent Soul?” The grey-robed Daoist smiled and cordially beckoned to them . His intimate manners unconsciously aroused in a good impression amongst them .

The Child Fire Dragon returned the smile, but he spoke with an unexpectedly harsh tone, “Brother Heavencrystal, I’ve brought two uninvited guests . Surely you won’t refuse them?”

“Why would I do that? This place welcomes all Fellow Daoists . Besides, I am acquainted with Fellow Daoist lu . It is only . . . ” The old Daoist’s gaze hovered towards Han Li .

Han Li took a step forward and saluted him, “I am the Drifting Cloud Sect’s Han Li, a newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator . I hope Daoist Heavencrystal can provide me some guidance in the future . ”

Daoist Heavencrystal pleasantly smiled and said, “So it turned out to be a sect member of wFellow Daoist Lu . From his young age, he certain to have boundless prospects . ”

“Enough, old friend . The others should be arriving soon . We’ll be going upstairs . ” From his direct words, it seemed the Child Fire Dragon had a rather deep friendship with him .

Daoist Heavencrystal sighed, “Brother Lan is still so impatient . Almost everyone has already arrived . I’m sure a few of the more impatient ones have already started trading as well . Here are two black spirit masks for those Fellow Daoists . Brother Lan, do you need one?” He then flipped his hands and summoned two black wood masks into his hands with a flash of white light . Talisman characters appeared on their surface .

The Child Fire Dragon’s cheeks bulged as if he were annoyed . He snorted and said, “Of course you should know that with my stature, regardless of any illusions I use, I cannot conceal myself . ”

“Of course . Please come up . This old man will join you in a bit . ” Daoist Heavencrystal casually smiled and tossed the marks to Han Li and Lu Luo . At that same time, a white streak of light show towards the mist behind him . The mist disappeared and revealed stairs of glittering light that led to the second floor .

Without any further courtesies, the Child Fire Dragon wordlessly walked around the table and climbed to the second floor . Lu Luo and Han Li saluted the old Daoist before following him up the stairs .

Once Han Li discovered that his mask was exactly the same as Lu Luo’s, he wore it without any reservations and climbed up the stairs .

The mask was cold to the touch and soft . To Han Li’s surprise, it was so comfortable, it felt as if it wasn't even there .

He turned his head to look at Lu Luo and saw that he also wore the mask, turning his face into an icy wooden carving . Han Li faintly smiled at the sight .

At that moment, the three had already arrived on the second floor . It was well lit with over a hundred fist-sized moonstones embedded in the ceiling and walls .

But what surprised Han Li most of all was that the second floor was several times more spacious than the first floor . It appeared far narrower than the first floor from the outside .

Of course, the second floor wasn’t empty . There were tables lined up against the walls with chairs accompanying each of them . There were various clothed cultivators sitting in many of them . From their bodies and hair, it appeared there were men and women of all ages .

When Han Li and company arrived, countless cold glints swept past them .

Many of them clearly recognized the unconcealed Child Fire Dragon; the expressions of their eyes varied anywhere from goodwill, hatred, and indifferences . There were a few gazes that even carried unconcealable killing intent, suggesting they formed animosity in the past .

The Child Fire Dragon was unconcerned with these gazes and led Han Li and Luo Lu to an empty table . At that moment, Han Lu glanced at the others from the sect .

Because of the masks’ concealment, those with formidable spiritual sense such as Han Li were unable to clearly see their faces . However, there was no doubt that each of them were NAscent Soul cultivators from their spiritual Qi fluctuations . There were even two among them that were at mid Nascent Soul stage, but they were sitting alone and none dared to rashly sit next to them .

What appeared to be a small pavilion held at least twenty Nascent Soul cultivators, something that was rarely heard of .

Before this, Han Li hadn’t seen so many Nascent Soul eccentrics in one place . It seemed one’s cultivation had to be at a similar level to encounter so many cultivators .

Han Li’s gaze flickered and it suddenly focused at a particular corner of the floor . As Daoist Heavencrystal had mentioned, there were already a few impatient cultivators that had gathered around a table .

Their lips were moving from voice transmissions and they occasionally exchanged jade boxes and small bottles in some small scale trades .

However, most of the other cultivators were sitting with their eyes closed in meditation . They were waiting for everyone to gather before they started trading . It seemed what was being traded prematurely wasn't anything particularly valuable .

Also, in what seemed to be an attempt to avoid being recognized, many of the cultivators were completely silent, and only spoke to one another through voice transmissions .

The second floor of the pavilion had completely maintained its silence in a bizarre and stifling manner .

The Child Fire Dragon hadn’t bothered to wear a mask, attracting many gazes as a result . Nevertheless, there were none who took the initiative to reveal themselves to him .

Sitting right across from Han Li and company was an extremely fat man, who also wore no mask . His waist was four times thicker than the average person and even caused his chair to slightly deform . Regardless, this person didn’t seem to mind in the last . When he saw Han Li glance at him, he shot a beaming smile in his direction . However, the many layers of fat on his face made it difficult to accept his kind intentions .

Sitting at the plump man’s side was a very shapely female cultivator . Although she wore a mask, her eyes with vivid and captivating . Still, everyone present was certain of the cunning of those around them, and none paid any particular attention to the woman’s charm .

When Han Li saw this, he heard Lu Luo’s voice transmission, “Junior martial brother Han, be careful . That fatty may seem harmless, but together with the woman at his side, they are the Devil Dao Harmonious Bond Sect’s Flesh Rouge Devils . With their secret pair cultivation techniques, they are able to contend against even mid Nascent Soul cultivators . Avoid provoking them, they are incredibly difficult to deal with!”

When Han Li heard this, he felt his heart tremble and he immediately added their names onto a long list of those he should be wary of . After he finished observing the characteristics of all others in the room, he closed his eyes and silently meditated .

Over the period of a long while, several masked Nascent Soul cultivators continuously entered the room .

Daoist Heavencrystal was the last to enter, drawing the eyes of all the cultivators present . He directly walked to the center of the floor and casually waved his arm, summoning a table and chair towards him with white light . He then smiled and said, “Everyone should’ve already arrived . If nobody has anything else to say, let us start the trade meet . ”
