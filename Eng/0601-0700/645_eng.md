Mu Peiling blushed and softly said, “As you bid, Sir!”

Han Li withdrew his wanton gaze from her body . He took a purple jade medallion out from his robes and placed it on the table . He said with a cold voice, “Return and handle your affairs . Pick a mountain for your cave residence as well . This is a restriction medallion for the surrounding formations . If you wear it on your person, you will be able to leave my spell formations as you please . Once everything is prepared, I will place down a soul restriction on you and have you officially become my concubine, but let's get the ugly talk out of the way first . I don’t care if you have an ideal husband or a beloved . Cleanly sever ties with them; you are my concubine now . If you still have feelings of longing for them and still possess relations with them, don’t blame me for being ruthless . Now is the time to withdraw if you still possess any second thoughts . ”

“Since I was small, I’ve dedicated myself to walking the path of immortal cultivation . How could I have a beloved? Besides, I have steeled my resolve . I won’t back down when the matter has already been decided . ” Without a further thought, the woman nimbly took the jade medallion .

Han Li nodded his head and said no further . Soon after, he summoned a huge ape puppet and had it guide Mu Peiling outside .

Mu Peiling revealed a trace of surprise upon seeing the puppet . The puppet fearsomely held a level of spiritual Qi similar to her own . She was also puzzled as to why the white-clothed woman wasn’t there as well .

However, she knew that it was best to avoid probing too deeply and obediently kept quiet, following the puppet out from the cave residence .

Once the woman left, a white fox walked out from what appeared to be an empty corner of the room . “Since Master planned on taking this woman as a concubine for her punishment, why did you agree to wait thirty years? Could it be you have other plans?”

Han Li calmly admitted, “Of course I do . To tell the truth, I have no plans to touch her before she reaches Core Formation . ”

Silvermoon hopped onto the table in front of Han Li and gazed at Han Li in a puzzled manner, “Huh? Why might that be?”

When Han Li saw her adorable appearance, he couldn’t help but smile . He took out a pink jade talisman from his waist and placed it on the table .

“Do you recall the storage pouch I looted off the disciple of Archsaint Six Paths? This jade slip was in his storage pouch . It contains many Devil Dao pair cultivation arts . ”

Silvermoon looked at the jade slip and then glanced at Han Li with a trace of suspicion . Since Han Li took this out, she knew that Han Li would continue his explanation .

As expected, Han Li lightly stoked the pink jade slip with his finger and unhurriedly said, “There are many secret techniques contained inside this jade talisman . Although they are more powerful than ordinary pair cultivation techniques, the difference can’t be considered much . However, there were two secret techniques among them that were particularly exceptional . One of them, the Dragon Guiding Arts, are particularly suitable for Core Formation males, allowing a Core Formation cultivator to unceasingly draw on the vital Yin essence of a woman with a special constitution, greatly raising their cultivation .

“However, this secret technique was certain to cause great harm to the woman’s origin Qi . As such, any male cultivators using this technique would best have many concubines . Considering the many Foundation Establishment women at Archsaint Six Paths’ disciple’s side, he should’ve cultivated this technique . Otherwise, there would be no way he could’ve cultivated to late Core Formation stage at his young age, no matter how amazing his aptitude . After all, he didn’t have a miraculous bottle that could age plants .

“As for the other technique, the Copulative Essence Arts, its a secret pair cultivation technique that is specialized for Nascent Soul men . Unlike the Dragon Guiding Arts, it requires a woman to possess cultivation at Core Formation stage . Once a woman cultivates this technique to a deep enough stage, the male cultivator would be able to forcefully break through a cultivation bottleneck in an instant by seizing her vital Yin . It is only natural that I wish for this woman to cultivate with all her might . This technique requires a woman possessing deep cultivation after all . ”

“Dragon Guiding Arts! Copulative Essence Arts! Isn’t it an exaggeration for a pair cultivation technique to be so fearsome?!” The small fox blinked and revealed disbelief .

Han Li sighed and said, “I had similar thoughts to you at the beginning, for a pair cultivation technique to be so fearsome; its simply unprecedented . However, I discovered the name of the person who established these pair cultivation techniques inside the jade slip, and my doubts were immediately dispelled . ”

Silvermoon seemed to have thought of something and couldn’t help but softly shout, “Yi! Could it be . . . ”

Han Li said with a deep voice, “That’s right! These two pair cultivation techniques were personally established by Archsaint Six Paths . Since he is a late Nascent Soul cultivator and is renowned as the number one figure in the Scattered Star Sea’s Devil Dao, these two techniques should be greatly effective . Otherwise, Archsaint Six Paths’ disciple couldn’t have kept it so closely on his person . ”

Silvermoon tilted her furry head and hesitantly asked, “So Master plans on using this woman to cultivate . . . ”

“That’s right . Once this woman reaches late Core Formation stage, we will both cultivate the Copulative Essence Arts . And once I reach a bottleneck, I will use this technique to breakthrough it . After all, there are few medicine pills that are capable of assisting in the cultivation of a Nascent Soul cultivator . From now on, my cultivation speed will be pathetically slow . Since a vast majority of Nascent Soul cultivators are stuck at the early stage, it can be observed that it is extremely difficult to breakthrough the bottleneck to mid Nascent Soul stage . As such, I must make an attempt, regardless of the validity of the technique’s effects .

“It is only a pity that according to what was described, the bottleneck breakthrough will only occur for the first time the technique is used . It will have no such effect afterwards . Of course, this technique also benefits the woman involved as well, but not nearly to the extent of the male cultivator . Tell me, did you think that I truly thought I acquired a concubine merely because I could?” Han Li glanced at the white fox at the side and coldly smiled .

Silvermoon appeared to sigh with relief and smiled, “At first, I did! I had thought that Master has grown proud after forming a Nascent Soul and thought to take in a concubine as a result . ”

When Han Li heard this, he wore a vague expression . He then expressionlessly said, “Although I will place the woman underneath a soul restriction, it is better that she doesn’t learn of all the secrets in the cave residence . I will be able to control this woman’s very life, but I cannot control her thoughts . Just because I treat her well doesn’t necessarily mean she will be grateful . I will first treat her with great caution so I may avoid being betrayed from a moment of carelessness .

“This ‘Martial Aunt’ Mu is rather intelligent, but it would be best to keep watch of her . If she truly wishes to follow me and is unswayed by the wills of others, I will not treat her unfairly and will assist in her cultivation . After all, I have an abundance of low grade medicine pills . Silvermoon, keep an eye on her for me when you’re free . It should be a trivial effort given your skills . ”

Silvermoon obediently agreed, “Yes, Master! When you are in secluded cultivation, I will particularly pay attention to her . ”

“That will do . These thirty years should be enough for me to read her . I hope she doesn’t disappoint me!” During that final sentence, Han Li’s tone became sullen .

Several days later, Mu Peiling returned to the mountain and was subjected to a soul restriction by Han Li . Afterwards, she was gifted with a few bottles of medicine pills effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators . This gift had amazed her and caused her face to blossom with beauty from her delight . She eagerly expressed her thanks with adoring respect . It appeared this woman had truly thought of herself as his concubine .

After the silver-haired old man and Cultivator Lu were notified that Han Li had taken her in as a concubine, they expressed their congratulations and each gifted a top grade magic tool to Mu Peiling .

Han Li smiled in response and politely thanked them .

From then on, Mu Peiling began to dedicatedly cultivate at one of the smaller mountains surrounding the main cave residence, provided both with Han Li’s guidance and medicine pills .

During this time, Han Li would occasionally pay a visit to the cave residences of the other two Nascent Soul cultivators in the sect, humbly asking for cultivation instruction . Since the two Drifting Cloud elders intended to sincerely accept Han Li into their fold, they hid nothing from him, much to Han Li’s benefit . In hindsight, Han Li felt his choice to stay was extremely wise .

Several months later, Han Li was delighted to discover the Spirit Well Tree in the medicine garden started to shed Wine Nectar . He hastily began to refine the Brightsight Water according to the instructions that the dishevel-haired cultivator left behind .

With Han Li’s grandmaster-level skills in medicine pill refinement, he quickly grasped the knack of refining the spirit water and found it easy to concoct despite his first few failed attempts .

Currently inside the pill refinement room, Han Li was holding onto a small bottle of Brightsight Water that he concocted earlier . His gaze flickered when something suddenly came to mind, and his expression soon became determined . He opened the bottle with one hand and caused his hand to flash with azure light in the other . A ball of translucent blue liquid flew out from the bottle and slowly made its ways towards Han Li’s forehead .

By the the time the water arrived in front of Han Li’s forehead, it suddenly stopped and became completely still .

Han Li looked at the water with narrowed eyes and remained silent . A short moment later, he opened his mouth and breathed out a small mist of azure light and enveloped the water . Then as the water sparkled, two fine strands of water suddenly shot out and entered Han Li’s eyes .

Han Li felt his eyes warm up, but a moment later, the warmth turned into a bone-chilling cold . He shut his eyes and trembled from the sensation .
