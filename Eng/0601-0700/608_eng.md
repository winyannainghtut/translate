Han Li was the last to descend into the valley . Seeing that everyone around him each started to take the miasma treatment pills, he couldn’t help but smile . With his body’s essence purified, any miasma entering his body was cleansed with a single breath .

At that moment, the group was flying straight towards the center of the valley .

“That demon fox is extremely clever . We will only get one chance to capture it . As such, we must find a wide area so that cannot allow it to escape from the formation . There is a flat field free of mud not far ahead of us . We won’t have to fear it running away by digging into mud . ” From Senior Martial Brother Wang’s plans, it seemed he had deliberated much about this matter .

Having followed Senior Martial Brother Wang this long, the others in the group naturally raised no objections . As for Han Li, he merely smiled and remained silent .

A short moment later, the five arrived in a lush flat field with short shrubbery sparsely scattered about .

Without waiting for Senior Martial Brother Wang’s instruction, Kui Huan and the others landed on the field and examined their nearby surroundings .

Following a quick discussion, Kui Huan walked to the center of the field and dug open a small hole . He then carefully took out the Huangjing that he bought from the market and shallowly buried it in the hole so that it slightly emerged from the ground . Afterwards, he sprinkled a bit more dirt on top to make it a bit more natural . Suddenly, a faint medicinal aroma immediately began to spread around .

“Good, that will do . The Snowcloud Fox has a very keen sense of smell . Even if the Huangjing is three feet buried, the Snowcloud Fox will surely smell its aged medicinal scent . ” Kui Huang stood up and dusted off his hands with satisfaction . He then recalled something and took out a white formation flag . “Ah right, Junior Martial Brother, take this . It’s an Obscure Track Formation flag . ”

Han Li nodded his head and calmly received the small flag . At that moment, Senior Martial Brother Wang began to brief the party .

He solemnly said, “In a moment, everyone will take up a position on higher ground . When the demon fox appears, we’ll all use the formation flags at the same time and envelope the field in an illusion formation . I am confident that since the Snowcloud Fox only recently turned into a demon beast, it will not be able to flee from the formation . ”

All the others nodded their heads in agreement before taking off on their flying magic tools . They all motionlessly floated about a hundred-fifty meters into the air with formation flags in their hands . They each used shallow invisibility magic techniques to conceal themselves as they waited .

Since this involved such a large amount of spirit stones, Kui Huan and the others each appeared rather nervous as they unblinkingly stared down below . Even Senior Martial Brother Wang wore a grave expression as his eyes deeply gazed .

In contrast, Han Li was the most calm amongst them . He was holding the white formation flag in a single hand as he swept his gaze around . In fact, Han Li had already enveloped his spiritual sense over the area of a kilometer around them . He would be the first know if any winds blew or any bush shook .

The area became deathly silent as two hours passed by . Kui Huan’s neck began to ache as he stood on his magic tool from his continuously watching down below . His face revealed faint impatience . He glanced at Senior Martial Brother Wang and thought to say something to him, but after some hesitation, he shut his mouth upon further thought . There was nothing to complain about even if they had to wait a while longer . This was all in order to capture the demon fox .

After yet another hour passed by, most of the group began to feel anxious . As for Han Li, his expression began to stir as he stared at a patch of nearby shrubbery .

At that moment, Kui Huan couldn’t help but stir . He licked his lips and was about to say something when he heard Han Li’s cold voice through a voice transmission, “Be careful, the demon fox has already arrived . It is hiding in a bush in the west . Don’t scare it away . ”

The other three also heard Han Li’s voice transmission .

In response, all of them glanced at the west bushes in alarm only to discover that nothing strange could be seen . They couldn’t help but be skeptical of Han Li’s words, but their relaxed attitudes became vigilant once more .

After the time it took to finish a meal, surprise flickered from their eyes . A foot-long, snow-white beast slowly walked out from a bush . It turned its head around with each step and its whiskers occasionally twitched in hopeful anticipation . It was incredibly adorable .

Upon seeing this, the other four grew vigilant and nervously grasped onto the formation flags in their hands .

The white fox didn’t glance up at the five . After seeing that there was nothing strange in its surroundings, it grew slightly more courageous and it began to silently walk over in the direction of the Huangjing .

However, when it arrived about thirty meters away from the Huangjing, it suddenly stopped and its small pink nose suddenly sniffed in the air . A trace of doubt flickered from its eyes as if it had discovered something .

This scene had caused Senior Martial Wang to lose his calm and he loudly shouted, “Now!” His formation flag dropped to the ground in a streak of yellow light . When Han Li and the others heard this, they threw down the formation flags without hesitation and each uttered several incantations .

Five different lights began to shine from the flags as soon as they touched the floor . A large expanse of yellow mist then developed the field, sealing it from every direction . The Five Elements Obscure Track Formation had taken effect .

When the Snowcloud Fox saw this, it naturally knew that it was trapped . It immediately released several panicked howls and turned into a white blur as it shot into the yellow mist in an attempt to escape .

The group of cultivators appeared somewhat relieved upon seeing this, but they didn’t relax just yet . The illusion formation merely changed the direction of the white fox so that it turned in circles and kept it within . The cultivators naturally wished to exhaust the beast first before they set on capturing it .

The group of people beamingly smiled as if this operation was a success . After the small fox ran around inside the yellow mist, it suddenly blurred several times before collapsing to the ground . It no longer stood up .

When the others saw this, they couldn’t help but feel frightened and looked at each other in dismay .

Senior Martial Brother Wang’s face grew sullen and he calmly said, “Do not release the restriction . We will continue to maintain it . Junior Martial Brother Ma, go down and see what is happening . The Obscure Track Formation is only able to trap, not cause harm . From the fox’s sly nature, it is most likely pretending to be dead . ”

The others were greatly relieved upon hearing him and the youth surnamed Ma wordlessly descended .

Han Li faintly smirked at the scene and glanced down with a mysterious smile .

The short and stout Senior Martial Brother Ma was rather fast . After a short moment, he had already entered the yellow mist and was several steps away from the fox .

He carefully grabbed the white fox tail and boldly shook it several times . As a result, the white fox was unresponsive as if were truly dead .

As a result, the youth surnamed Ma felt slightly panicked and immediately pressed his ear against the beast’s chest .

Soon after, Senior Martial Brother Ma flusteredly shouted out from within the mist, “Senior Martial Brother, quickly come down, the demon fox’s body is ice-cold . Perhaps its heart had stopped from fright!”

“Impossible!” Senior Martial Brother Wang couldn’t help but change his expression .

Kui Huan nervously said, “Senior Martial Brother, let’s release the spell formation and take another look . Our spiritual power cannot sustain the restriction for much longer . ”

The cultivator surnamed Xi remained silent but a trace of worry appeared in his eyes . The demon beast wouldn’t be worth much if it were dead .

After a moment of hesitation Senior Marital Brother Wang nodded his head and said, “Fine! We’ll release the spell formation since Junior Martial Brother Ma has already grabbed onto the spirit beast . ”

When Han Li heard this, he calmly rubbed his chin, but he didn’t display the slightest opposition .

Suddenly, the cultivators began to mutter some words and point to the ground, causing four of the flags to shoot back into their hands as streaks of light .

In the instant the yellow mist dissipated, a short and stout youth had placed his finger on the small beast’s nose as if he were testing something .

The three dropped down with sullen expression . However, Han Li remained standing in his original position as he glanced at the white fox down below . His face revealed an odd expression .
