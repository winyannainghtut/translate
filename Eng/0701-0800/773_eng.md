With an expressionless face, Han Li raised his hand, releasing a blue light from his sleeve . In the blink of an eye, it expanded to become a huge shield and received the strike from the huge brick . Bang! Yellow and blue light intertwined as the brick and the shield remained at a standstill .

When Han Li saw the shield fall back towards him, he calmly pointed at it, and in a flash of blue light, it came to a sudden stopped . Then, the huge brick circled around the shield and smashed towards Han Li .

Han Li coldly smiled and disappeared once more in a flash of silver light . The yellow-robed old man was alarmed by this and raised his hand without another thought, summoning a small purple flag into his hand . It quickly transformed into a purple cloud that surrounded his body .

In that same moment, the old man heard thunder coming from his left . As soon as Han Li appeared, he opened his mouth and spat a small sword towards the purple cloud . An instant later, a layer of deep blue flame emerged from within it .

When the old man saw the blue flames on top of the sword, he lost his composure and wore a faceful of terror . His body instantly blurred three meters away in an attempt to dodge the sword .

But against his complete expectations, a woman suddenly appeared behind him as if she had already anticipated where he would dodge . She raised her hand and released an azure ball that struck at the spell warrior like a bolt of lightning .

The woman appeared without a trace, like a ghost . It was as if Han Li coordinated with this woman to perform a precise and incisive strike .

Even with such skilled execution, the old man was able to see this coming through his spiritual sense . But at such a short distance, he was unable to dodge; his only choice was to surge the entirety of his magic power into the purple cloud covering his body . He was somewhat confident in the treasure that formed from the transformed purple cloud .

A huge explosion sounded out as golden and azure light brilliant flashed . The purple cloud had crumpled in the exchange and the old man within was in a pathetic shape . Half of his body was gone, and the remaining half was engulfed in azure flames .

Overwhelmed with disbelief and furious alarm, resentment appeared on the old man’s face as he gritted his teeth . With a boom, body combusted and a blinding streak of yellow light flew through the skies, revealing an inch-large Nascent Soul with the exact same face as the old man .

Seeing the circumstances were far from good, he decisively anticipated to abandon his body and flew out as a Nascent Soul in a vain attempt to flee .

However, Han Li had already anticipated this . Just as the old man’s Nascent Soul attempted to escape, he disappeared in a flash of silver light and blocked the Nascent Soul’s escape path . He waved his hand, summoning a golden net from his hand in a clang of thunder . In that same moment, a small sword covered in blue flames shot out from his sleeve as well .

The Nascent Soul wore a face of terror upon the sight of Han Li, and spat out an inch-large bowl in its panic . The sparkling silver bowl charged forward to meet the oncoming golden net, and before they made contact, the old man’s Nascent Soul caused it to rupture with a spell seal . In a burst of silver light, countless fragments shot at the lightning net, faintly shaking it upon impact .

In that short moment of delay, the Nascent Soul employed an instantaneous movement technique . In a flash of yellow light, the Nascent Soul disappeared without a trace, only to appear a hundred meters away . It then disappeared from sight in a brilliant streak of yellow light .

The golden net was a step too late and allowed the prey to escape . Han Li frowned and glanced in the direction the Nascent Soul had escaped, possessing no intention of chasing it .

“Such a wise and decisive character is rarely seen . In order to save his life, he actually destroyed his own personal magic treasure . ” A white-clothed woman suddenly appeared, holding the old man’s storage pouch in her hand .

Han Li gloomily snorted . “A mere stroke of luck!” With both the Thunderstorm Wings and the Celestial Ice Flames, the Moulan spell warrior was as good as him . It seemed killing an off-guard high-grade spell warrior was harder than he thought .

Han Li glanced at Silvermoon and said, “Regardless, it seems your movement technique is much more powerful than before . You are even able to conceal yourself a close distance away . ”

Silvermoon smiled . “The Four Pupiled Fox is truly adept as concealment techniques . With my recent advancements, I’ll be able to easily attack them, given that Master is occupying their attention . ”

“Good!” Han Li indifferently nodded . Although Silvermoon was only his tool spirit, she was also the only other person who knew of the secret of his small bottle . But at an unknown time, he faintly felt a veil of mystery shroud her .

After a few more words with Silvermoon, Han Li turned his head to examine the battlefield . After further examining it, Han Li was able to see through the chaos .

At the greatest heights of the sky, there were six late Nascent Soul cultivators battling . Excluding them, there were three sections of the battle . One was the small-scale skirmishes; cultivators and spell warriors would head out in various sized groups spanning from several tens to even a thousand, and would fight at each other in close quarters .

These cultivators and spell warriors were very adept at fighting in their groups . As a result, they were much stronger together than alone . Both sides found it difficult to eliminate one another, and they were stuck at a standstill .

Additionally, they were battles were a few individuals fought against a crowd of enemies . These cultivators and spell warriors possessed superior cultivation . These battles were far more dangerous than the group battles; a single mistake could lead to death in both body and soul .

Finally, there were those wielding unfathomable techniques and treasures as they stood in confrontation .

The most eye-catching of them was a large black mist floating in the air, releasing sharp wails . Any spell warrior that was captured by the mist immediately fell from the sky as a corpse . Whenever it appears, the nearby spell warriors would always fearfully keep their distance .

And behind the ghost mist, there would be several fearless spell warriors that continuously struck at the mist with wind and lightning attribute spell techniques and magic treasures . Each strike seemed to scatter a small portion of the mist . However, there were still people continuously waving their flag magic tools within the mist and summoning more mist . This left the Moulan spell warriors without a good plan to deal with it .

In another area, there were a dozen Nascent Soul grade cultivators that were currently engaged in a battle against a three-hundred-meter tall stone giant . It appeared to be made of ordinary stone, but not only was its figure large, but a few small stones would rain down every time it moved its body .

These cultivators didn’t dare to receive the giant’s attack even under the protection of the spell formations . Additionally, there were several spell warriors standing on top of its head and shoulders . They were assisting the giant with their own magic treasures .

There were also a few cultivators and spell warriors that were engaged in a battle using magnificent treasures, each possessing power far beyond ordinary ancient treasures . These sect and tribe protecting treasures have greatly opened Han Li’s horizons .

Although Han Li emerged from the blood barrier, he remained idle as he observed the nearby fights due to the chaos . He was about a kilometer away from the nearest battles, but even so, two Moulan Sages emerged from the fray and flew towards Han Li with overbearing momentum .

Seeing Han Li ruthlessly dispatch of a similarly ranked spell warrior in an instant, the two had no certainty of victory . However, they couldn’t allow this Nascent Soul cultivator to reign free, or the damage he will cause will be far too great .

“Come!” Han Li coldly ordered Silvermoon . He then flew towards a neighboring blood barrier .

When Silvermoon saw this, she wore a strange smile as she chased after him .

An azure streak of light appeared above the blood-red barrier, and was soon struck by a lightning bead . Afterwards, Han Li disappeared once more in front of another blood barrier . Han Li planned free these other Nascent Soul cultivators before planning what to do .

A huge explosion sounded out, along with a streak of scarlet light flying out from the gap in the blood barrier . With a series of laughter, the freed man said, “I, Shattered Soul, cannot thank you enough for your assistance . ” The scarlet light disappeared to reveal a grey-robed cultivator .

‘Daoist Shattered Soul?’ Han Li was slightly surprised to see that this was the first person he rescued .

“Fellow Daoist, block those two for me while I rescue the others . ” With a quick thought, Han Li immediately gave him a voice transmission .

“Yi! So it turned out to be Fellow Daoist Han . Your kindness cannot be thanked with words . Please allow me to deal with them!” The grey-robed cultivator revealed shock upon seeing Han Li, but he soon agreed . In a streak of white light, he flew over to face the two Moulan sages .

When Han Li saw this with his spiritual sense, he inwardly smiled and quickly flew over to another blood barrier . With a wave of his hand, another azure light was released .

But at that moment, something unexpected had occurred . The top of the blood barrier flashed with grey light, revealing a large embroidered-robed man . He looked at the incoming lightning bead with a solemn expression .

Han Li was shocked . How was this person able to conceal himself there without even the slightest trace . When Han Li swept his spiritual sense past this person, he couldn’t help but reveal his alarm .
