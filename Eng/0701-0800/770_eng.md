With Devil Concord’s challenge ringing through the air, the shriveled old man frowned, but he soon spoke with a tranquil tone, “We will have the fight with the three great Heavenly South cultivators sooner or later . However, I must remain behind to direct the battle and cannot fight . I’ll have to trouble Sect Master Fang to occupy one of them . It should prove an easy task given that you’ve cultivated the Heavenflash Devil Arts to its peak stage and can take in the Heavenfiend Devil’s true Qi into your body . ”

“Since I’ve already come to an agreement with you, I will be taking action . I also wish to test the abilities to the top Devil Dao cultivator in the Heavenly South . ” The black-robed man spoke with a cold tone . With green light glowing from his eyes, black Qi began to slowly ascend from his body before he took off in the direction of Devil Concord . As for the scholarly man surnamed Zhong and the short man surnamed Bu, they wordlessly flew after him in streaks of silver and red light .

When the three great Heavenly South cultivators saw this, they hastily pursued them . The six of them then disappeared into the clouds without further trace of them .

Not long after, the color of the nearby sky began to chance in color . It turned from fire-red one moment to pitch-black, another with thunderous explosions echoing across the skies . Flashes of light would occasionally flash and illuminate the clouds .

As six late-Nascent Soul cultivators began to fight, the battle between the cultivator and spell warrior armies on the ground and lower sky unfolded .

However, it was vastly different from a battle between a small number of cultivators, when they would approach and strike one another when they were in range . Instead, both armies chanted various incantations and first activate various defensive formations around themselves, slowly raising a huge light barrier at the center of two armies, shrouding their main forces .

It was clear to see that the cultivators had finished setting up their defenses first . However, that doesn’t mean that the cultivator’s elemental Daoist techniques are superior to the spell warrior’s spirit techniques . This display of speed was only because a majority of defensive spell formations were made from formation tools .

With the initiative seized, Long Han — the commander of the Heavenly South Army — resolutely gave the order to begin the attack .

The first wave of attacks were to be launched by over ten rare far-range treasures, the huge gong Han Li saw earlier being one of them .

At that moment, the platform supporting the gong was already placed at the very front of the army division . It floated off the ground as if weighing nothing and stopped about a hundred meters in the air with eight large yellow-clothed men standing guard around it . As for the large man that had been sitting at its side, he was now stood at the gong’s side with a three meter tall iron hammer in his hand, his eyes still closed .

A short distance away, there were two men that were raising a twenty-meter-tall triangular banner that shined with black light . There was a vivid and lifelike black flood dragon embroidered on top of it .

Farther away, there were nine red-clothed young women that were holding up a tray covered in red cloth that seemed to conceal something underneath . They were arranged in a strange formation as they gently floated in the air .

Among them were three embroidered-robed old men were each carrying a gourd half their height on their backs . They walked at the very front of their troop . These three groups were amongst the first to hear the order to attack .

The large man standing next to the copper gong suddenly opened his eyes . An aura of yellow light suddenly emitted from his body, and he swung the large hammer at the center of the gong as fiercely as he could . A blinding golden light glared for just a moment before disappearing . In the instant the golden light appeared, it had dissolved into specks of starlight before launching themselves towards the enemy . But just as soon as it flew about forty meters, the golden specks had turned into clouds of golden mist with a series of pops . The large man struck the bronze gong repeatedly, launching barrage after barrage of golden specks from the gong . The golden mist soon turned into a wave as it rushed towards the spell warriors .

The triangular black banner was wildly shaken by the two cultivators underneath it, releasing a black flood dragon out of seemingly nowhere . The flood dragon flew through the air, leaving behind threads of azure and black smoke from its mouth . Then with a fierce gust of wind, a black windstorm formed, blowing rock and sand all around it and preventing nearby cultivators from watching it .

The young red-clothed women simultaneously rested their hands on top of the large tray they were carrying and uttered pleasant incantations . In a flash of red light, nine brilliant red copper plates flew out from the tray and began to twirl around each other in the air .

They were all meter-long fire-red mirrors that shined with spirit light . Countless fist-sized firebirds emerged from them, their bodies and mouths all burning with flame . With a series of clear cries, they shot towards the spell warrior army like arrows .

The three embroidered-robed old men stood in a triangle formation before taking out the giant gourds on their back . As soon as they were opened, a bone-piercing icy white Qi instantly spread to an area in front of it, covering it in a layer of frost . The frost quickly spread towards the spell warriors .

The strike from these exceptional treasures occurred at nearly the same time the spell warriors managed to raise their own spell formation barrier . Even under the shriveled old man’s command, their only option was to endure . In the following instant, the golden mist, the black winds, and the firebirds all struck the spell warrior barrier with their attacks, causing it to tremble .

When Long Han saw this, he immediately ordered for the second wave of attacks before the first wave of attacks was over .

These wave of large-scale attacks were conducted through the use of secret techniques by the joint efforts of each sect . Various colored beams of light and overflowing devilfire shot out from the cultivator army, striking the spell warrior army immediately after the first wave of attacks . These attacks struck true once more, relentlessly damaging the spell warriors’ defensive barrier .

The shriveled old man wore a gloomy expression on his face . He completely didn’t expect that the spell techniques would activate so slowly and leave the spell warrior army vulnerable . Under such vicious attacks, his spell warriors were suppressed — without the opportunity to withdraw or launch a counterattack . These fearsome large scale attacks were something that even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn’t dare to receive without the protection of a spell formation . The shriveled old man turned to the black-robed woman at his side . “Madam Lu! It seems we will need you to use your huge beasts, else we won’t be able to hold our ground . ”

The woman smiled and carelessly said, “Since our sect master has lent them to you, feel free to use them . There is no need to tell me personally . ”

The shriveled old man nodded and immediately gave the order . A series of bellowing roars shook the skies, followed by the appearance of over ten huge silhouettes . They forcefully blocked the various attacks from hitting the spell warriors . These giant armored beasts immediately rushed in the direction of the cultivator army as soon as they appeared .

With their appearance, the cultivators split off their attacks with some of them attacking the beasts while others relentlessly attacked the spell warrior army . Several high grade spell warriors quickly flew out at that moment , taking advantage of the weakened assault . As they flew, they tossed several tens of various colored beads into the air and began to mutter an incantation .

An inconceivable scene occurred before them . A few of the beads directly bore into the ground and disappeared from sight while a few others resolved in the air while wrapped in azure light . There were also those that produced clear water, pulsed with dazzling light, and emitted raging flames .

Soon after, these beads transformed into the form of demon beasts, such as thirty-meter-long yellow pythons, twenty-meter-tall fire wolves, transparent azure rocs, blue demon tortoises covered in icy mist, and much more .

As soon as these demon beasts appeared, they followed after the huge armored beasts and charged straight towards the cultivator armies .

Because of the innate defenses of the huge beasts along with armor and defensive spells, they were able to continue their charge despite the battered conditions of their bodies .

As for the strange beasts following after them, they were on the brink of destruction . Although they possessed a fearsome aura, most of their bodies scattered after a single attack, turning them into specks of spirit light . With their form dissipated, the beads fell onto the ground, completely void of any spiritual Qi .

The high grade spell warriors didn’t seem to mind this in the slightest . They raised their arms once more and tossed out another batch of pellets . With another incantation, the strange beasts came to life and fearlessly charged forward . When this occurred, many cultivators appeared alarmed and drew more attention towards these beasts, reducing the number of attacks on the spell warrior barrier .

Long Han’s expression sank . He hastily thought to give orders, but he hesitated .

With this difficultly acquired opportunity, the shriveled old man gave the order to begin their spell technique assault . In an instant various-colored spirit lights glowed . As incantations were chanted, three-meter-wide fireballs and icicles the size of trees began to form from thin air .

“Spirit technique spell formation!” When Long Han saw this, he muttered to himself . Knowing that he was incapable of suppressing their attack, he hastily sent a voice transmission . Suddenly, the rare treasures ceased their attacks and their owners hastily withdrew back into the ranks of their troops before returning back into the barrier .

At that same moment, over a thousand cultivators flew out from the barrier, each holding a meter tall formation flag . They quickly formed an astonishingly huge spell formation in a quick shuffle . The formation flags were then thrown in the air, forming a layer of rainbow light above the cultivator army, providing an additional barrier against the Moulan attack .

At that moment, several hundreds of huge fireballs and icicles struck down, enveloping their surroundings in waves of fire and mists of ice .

As for the huge beasts and the hollow demon beasts, they were already halfway to the cultivator army . Only the eight strongest of the huge beasts remained, and a majority of the second wave of hollow demon beasts had already been wiped out .

However, the demon beasts were completely fearless in the face of the vast cultivator army and continued their overbearing charge .
