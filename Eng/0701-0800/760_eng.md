Once most of the others left, Devil Concord expressionlessly said, “Junior Martial Brother, follow me! There is something I must say to you alone!” He then walked out of the hall without turning back .

Devil Cloudpart’s gaze wandered for a moment and silently followed him after some hesitation . It seemed he greatly feared the large black-robed man .

Master Sunreach waited until the Devil Concord and Devil Cloudpart departed before facing Han Li and the pale woman . “Fellow Daoists Han and Bai, let’s have a proper chat . How about you first take a look at the items you want and then decide whether or not you’ll be participating in the wagered battles . This humble Daoist understands your reasoning . After all, this matter will be extremely dangerous . If there isn’t a proper reward, no one would take the risk . But regardless if these items are to your satisfaction, I hope you two Fellow Daoists will be participating in the wagered battles . ”

Wei Wuya simply stood to the side and held his hands behind his back . He was calmly examining the two .

When they heard Master Sunreach, Han Li didn’t reply . Rather, the gorgeous pale woman frowned and said, “I am a woman who treads the solitary path . I do not care whether the Moulan invades the Heavenly South or the other way around . Were it not for your message speaking of this item, I wouldn’t have emerged from seclusion . Let’s get the ugly matters out of the way first . If what you have is not to my satisfaction, I will leave without reservations . ”

Master Sunreach wasn’t angered at her cold words, and instead replied with a warm tone, “Fellow Daoist Bai, there is no need for this! Although I was somewhat mistaken for what happened in the past, in truth I was doing what was best for you . ”

The woman’s expression sank and she coldly snorted, “I am the judge of whether or not it was mistaken! Enough of the past; bring out the item . ”

When Han Li heard this, he felt shocked despite his calm exterior . This woman surnamed Bai seemed to have a dispute of some sort, perhaps due to a past relationship .

When Master Sunreach saw the woman’s angered expression, he could only helplessly shake his head and took out a white jade box from his storage pouch .

It appeared rather ordinary as if made of common materials . But in the instant it appeared, the entire room dropped in temperature as if they were in the dead of a harsh winter . Even Han Li, who had long grown unfazed by weather, couldn’t help but feel unwell in the face of such cold .

The woman surnamed Bai revealed excitement upon sensing the icy cold that the box emitted .

At that moment, Master Sunreach wordlessly offered the jade box to the woman . After she took it into her hands, she opened it, revealing it clearly to Han Li .

They were a pair of transparent crystalline cocoons . They emitted a trace of cold Qi that caused Han Li to frown . They seemed to be cocoons of the Icefrost Silkworms, who were ranked last on the list of exotic insects .

Although this exotic insect wasn’t very powerful in battle, it has an inconceivable divine ability that is difficult to find . If this woman truly required these insects, it was quite possible she would agree to fight in the wagered battle .

“Why are they cocoons? These aren’t fully grown . ” To Han Li’s surprise, the woman’s expression turned unsightly upon seeing them .

Master Sunreach replied with a calm expression, “Fellow Daoist Bai, these Icefrost Silkworms were found a hundred meters deep inside a sheet of ice . They aren’t common; they are top grade Monarch Silkworms . Look at them with your spiritual sense . You’ll find that there is something exceptional about them . ”

“Monarch Silkworms?” The woman’s expression stirred and she doubtfully swept her spiritual sense past the cocoons . A short moment later, her expression relaxed .

“How about it? While these Monarch Silkworms are still in their cocoons, they should be more than enough for your uses . ”

After a moment of hesitation, the woman put away the box and said, “With this, I will be able to fight in the wagered battle . ”

Master Sunreach sighed with relief and smiled, “Good . With Fellow Daoist Bai’s Frostcloud Arts, she’ll be able to deal with those trifling spell warriors in a single move . ”

Afterwards, the woman expressionlessly said, “I’ll be taking my leave,” before heading out of the hall .

Master Sunreach bitterly smiled and shook his head . When Wei Wuya saw this, he chuckled and said nothing else .

Once the woman left the hall, Master Sunreach focused on Han Li and asked with a smile, “Fellow Daoist Han, just how much Auric Essence do you require?”

With completely open intentions, Han Li said, “I require much of it . It can be said that the more, the better . Of course, since Auric Essence is quite valuable, so long as you two Fellow Daoists bring it to me, I’ll exchange it for an equivalent price . I definitely won’t have you suffer a loss . ”

Master Sunreach chuckled . “From Fellow Daoist Han’s tone, it seems he possesses quite a bit of wealth . However, Fellow Daoist Han should know that at our realm, there are few items that are able to tempt Fellow Daoist Wei and I . Otherwise, we wouldn’t have relinquished so many of our worldly possessions for this war . ”

Han Li smiled and said nothing else . Instead, Wei Wuya sighed and suddenly spoke, “Fellow Daoist Sunreach, your tone may be bold, but Fellow Daoist Han was able to escape from a Moulan Divine Sage with only early Nascent Soul-stage cultivation . He is no ordinary cultivator . ”

Master Sunreach casually said, “Hehe, I’ve been rude . But regardless of what Fellow Daoist Han plans on using to trade for the Auric Essence, how about he first takes a look at it . If Fellow Daoist truly has an item that can tempt us, we’ll have no objections trading it for the entirety of the Auric Essence . ”

He then reached for his storage pouch and a white light flew into his palm, revealing three various-sized chunks of golden rock that magnificently glowed . The middle-aged Daoist handed them over to Han Li in one move .

Han Li’s heart pounded as he directly received the rocks, and he examined them with covetous desire .

The three chunks, one large and two small, were truly Auric Essence . The larger of the pieces was about the same size as the chunk that was auctioned off at the trade meet, about the size of a walnut . As for the smaller pieces, they were about half that size . This amount of Auric Essence should be enough for him to infuse tensome flying swords . However, it was somewhat lacking in quantity compared to what Han Li desired . Despite his calm expression, his eyes betrayed a trace of disappointment .

Master Sunreach was somewhat amazed to see this . Just how much Auric Essence did this man want? It was rather baffling . With that thought, he shot a glance at Wei Wuya .

Having seen Han Li’s expression, he also glanced at Master Sunreach and calmly took out a fist-sized chunk of Auric Essence from his sleeve .

When Han Li saw such a large chunk of Auric Essence in Wei Wuya’s hand, he grew delighted . Although this chunk of Auric Essence wasn’t enough for all seventy-two flying swords, with luck, this along with three smaller pieces should be enough for at least half of them . With thirty-six flying swords supported with the Swordlight Reflection Technique, it would be just enough for a small-scale Aureate Sword Formation .

With excitement in his heart, Han Li caught the chunk of Auric Essence that Wei Wuya tossed to him . After examining it with a deep breath, he said, “Although this may be all of your Auric Essence, it is still somewhat lacking . But it will be enough for me to participate in the wagered battle . Please take a look at these items and see if they are to your satisfaction . ”

After putting away the Auric Essence, he took out two differently colored jade boxes and handed them separately to Wei Wuya and Master Sunreach .

They each took the jade boxes and indifferently opened them . Wei Wuya weighted the box in his hand before opening it first .

One of the boxes had numerous scarlet fingernail-sized scales . The other box had a fist-sized jet-black tortoise shell . The two late Nascent Soul-stage cultivators were amazed by what they saw .

“What’s this?”

“Demon beast materials!”

Han Li explained, “That’s correct . Fellow Daoist Wei has the scales of a grade eight Venomous Flood Dragon . As for Fellow Daoist Sunreach, he possesses the shell of a grade eight demon tortoise . Although I don’t dare to say these items are heaven-defying existences, these metamorphosed demon materials are rarely seen in the Heavenly South . They should be more than enough to trade for Auric Essence . ”

Although Han Li’s tone was calm, he held much confidence . Grade eight demon beast materials were extremely hard to come by even in the Scattered Star Seas . Although many cultivators head out to the Outer Star Seas, very few were able to see demon beasts of that grade, let alone kill one .

And in the Heavenly South, grade seven and six demon beasts were killed as quickly as they appeared . None are left to ascent to grade eight stage . And apart from a few areas that large sects control, all other areas are devoid of any high-grade demon beasts .

Although Master Sunreach was able to quickly recover from his shock, Wei Wuya couldn’t help but shout in delight, “The scales of a grade eight Venomous Flood Dragon!”

Han Li was stunned for a moment before soon recalling that Wei Wuya cultivated a venomous cultivation art . As the body of a Venomous Flood Dragon is particularly deadly, these scales might prove to have other miraculous uses for him .

Just as Han Li hesitated as to what to say, Wei Wuya hastily extended his fingers and fiddled with one of the crimson scales . After carefully examining them, he began to ponder what there was to gain .

Master Sunreach felt somewhat amazed by Wei Wuya’s loss of demeanor . But after a strange expression appeared on his face, he smiled at Han Li and said, “Hehe! It seems Fellow Daoist Han’s item is much to Brother Wei’s liking . I am also rather interested in the tortoise shell . If these are true grade eight demon beast materials, they will be a fair trade for the Auric Essence as they are optimal materials for refining defensive magic tools . ”

Although he felt that Han Li’s words weren’t false, the sword-bearing Daoist found it hard to believe that an early Nascent Soul cultivator was able to acquire grade eight demon beast materials . He naturally had to determine whether or not the tortoise shell was genuine .
