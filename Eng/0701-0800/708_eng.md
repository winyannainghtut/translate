The fearsome, earth-shaking gales caused the magic treasures to unsteadily sway . They seemed to be restricted by the gale and were incapable of breaking free .

The bald spell warrior wore a bizarre smile and revealed an expression of pride . “Haha! If you won’t accept my kindness then I will use force . How reckless! Don’t expect me to stop after matters have reached this far . ” The bald spell warrior then grabbed the air and suddenly formed a huge hand from the yellow wings . It then made its way to grab the gorgeous woman .

The spell warriors planned to first grab the woman to make sure she lived and instantly exterminate the remaining four through a full display of his power .

The woman attempted to make use of her blazing flame sword magic treasure to block the large hand, but the gales had caused it to spin out of control . With no way of controlling it, she was incapable of saving herself, causing her complexion to pale .

Although the four cultivators wished to rescue the woman, they were disoriented and swept away by the wind . Only the fat old man with the deepest cultivation amongst them was able to deal with it somewhat better . In his worry, he forcefully raised his hand and released a meter long bolt of lightning to strike at the giant hand . However, the attack was completely ineffective .

When the yellow hand was only three meters away from grabbing the woman, it suddenly disappeared . At that same moment, the yellow-robed spell warrior roared in furious alarm . The windstorm that trapped the Core Formation cultivator suddenly weakened before soon disappearing . It was as if what had just happened as only an illusion .

The group of cultivators looked at each other with dismay and turned their gaze towards the bald spell warrior . However, he was angrily staring in an direction that was completely empty . They couldn’t help but reveal astonishment .

A fierce expression appeared on the spell warrior’s face and he furiously shouted, “Since you’ve dared to break my technique, why would you so stealthily hide yourself?” He seemed to no longer pay the Core Formation cultivators any notice .

A man’s voice voice leisurely spoke, “It isn’t that I’m hiding myself, but it’s just that your cultivation is too lacking to see me . It seems your esteemed self should’ve just recently entered Nascent Soul stage . You are far weaker than other spell warriors I’ve seen . ”

In an azure flash of light, a youth with a common appearance appeared before them .

When he saw that the five cultivators were caught in a desperate situation, he released an azure essence sword streak towards the feather . Once it was struck, the windstowm was easily dissolved .

The five were initially alarmed by Han Li’s appearance, but after sensing that he was at Nascent Soul Stage, they rejoiced, knowing that their lives were saved .

The female cultivator promptly saluted him from a distance and respectfully said, “Junior’s name is Nie Ying . Many thanks for Senior’s rescue . ”

“Nie Ying!” When Han Li heard this, he couldn’t help but take another look at the woman . He faintly remembered her .

However, now was not the time to deal with this, and he simply waved his arm, having the woman cease her salute . The woman and the old man didn’t seem to recognize him . It came as no surprise . In the past, he only met each of them once . Now that almost two hundred years had passed, it wasn’t odd that they didn’t recognize him .

With that thought, Han Li turned his gaze to the yellow-robed spell warrior and flatly said, “Since your esteemed self hasn’t run, it seems you wish to take me on?”

When the bald spell warrior heard this, he furiously smiled and heartily laughed, “Your esteemed self is also but an early Nascent Soul cultivator . Your words may be bold but I must oblige you to demonstrate your abilities . ”

With that said, the bald spell warrior formed a incantation gesture and he flicked his finger downward, shooting out two shining yellow pellets .

Han Li was faintly surprised by this and didn’t stop him . He merely narrowed his eyes and watched with interest .

The large man was inwardly delighted to see that Han Li remained idle and promptly uttered an incantation . His body was then covered with surging yellow clouds .

With a imposing voice, he softly shouted, “Rise!”

When Han Li heard this, his heart stirred as he expectantly glanced around him, but he saw nothing appear . In his doubt, he suddenly heard faint rumbling from the ground . The rumbling soon became thunderous and world-quaking .

Han Li swept his spiritual sense to the ground and revealed slight astonishment . Without any further thought, he swept his sleeve, sending two ten meter long swordstreaks out from his cuff down toeards the sound’s origin .

Han Li frowned . Although the sword streaks struck, they were ineffective .

With a rustle of wind, two forty-meter-long horned yellow dragons flew out from the ground and shot towards the bald cultivator . They then surrounded the bald cultivator and continuously revolved around him as if to protect him .

“This is? Han Li was amazed to discover the two fearsome yellow dragons were entirely formed from earth . They appeared as if they were truly alive . This lifelike aura seemed to originate from the yellow pellet on top of their heads . It pulsed with light, releasing a demonic yellow radiance .

“Hehe! Your esteemed self will be the first to witness the might of my constrained spirit beasts . Go!” The bald spell warrior furiously smiled and struck the earth dragons with yellow spell seals . The dragons subsequently charged towards Han Li with overbearing force .

Han Li furrowed his brow and lightly sighed . He opened his mouth and spat out a sliver of Celestial Ice Flames . The sliver of flames split into two even thinner flames and accurate struck the heads of each of the earth dragons .

The flames crackled and instantly enveloped the earth dragons in a layer of ice . The ice sculptures stopped ten meters in front of Han Li before dropping towards the earth .

Then with a flash of azure light, there were two clear explosions . The two frozen earth dragons had been easily shattered by two sword streaks that Han Li flung . Afterwards, he raised his hand and calmly summoned the two yellow pellets into his hand . He took a glance at them before placing them into his storage pouch .

Han Li leisurely said, “What other abilities do you have? Please don’t hesitate to use them . I wish to see the true might of the spell warriors’ spirit techniques!”

Silence looked over the yellow clouds for a moment as the spell warrior was shocked to the core at Han Li’s effortless disposal of his two earth dragons .

A moment later, the spell warrior’s sullen voice suddenly left the yellow clouds, “What sect do you come from? Might I know of your distinguished name? You don’t seem to match the description of any better known cultivators . Don’t tell me you also entered Nascent Soul stage in the last hundred years?” The last question was uttered with a savage tone .

“I am a nameless individual . If I said my name, you wouldn’t know of it . Since Fellow Daoist doesn’t intend to attack, I won’t be polite . ” Han Li’s expression grew sullen and he slapped the spirit beast pouch at his waist, releasing countless glistening golden flying insects into the air . They were the pure Gold Devouring Beetles that Han Li had meticulously nurtured .

This would be the first time that Han Li would be using them against an enemy . He wished to test how effective they would be against a Nascent Soul stage opponent .

“Gold Devouring Beetles! You actually possess them? And so many!?” Much to Han Li’s surprise, the yellow-robed spell warrior shouted the name of these insects with a voice of terror before Han Li could order the attack .

Without another word, the yellow-robed cultivator turned around and tore through the skies as a streak of yellow light . His swiftness had caused Han Li to hesitate and abandon the idea of pursuing him .

He wasn’t confident in being able to exterminate a Nascent Soul cultivator that was wholeheartedly focused on fleeing . Once a Nascent Soul manifested, even the lightning movement technique was lacking in speed to match it .

However, the bald spell warrior was able to recognize his Gold Devouring Beetles despite having somewhat inferior cultivation . It was truly shocking .

Although he felt somewhat puzzled, Han Li dropped the matter and recalled his still untested Spirit Beast Pouch . Afterwards, he slowly flew towards the Core Formation cultivators with a calm expression .

Before the Han Li drew close to them, the fat old man took the initiative to fly forward and deeply saluted him, “Many thanks for your assistance, Senior! Might Junior know your esteemed name? Junior is Yellow Maple Valley’s Lei Wanhe . We cannot thank you enough!”

In addition to Nie Yan who had introduced herself before, the others began to salute Han Li as well with gratitude and respect .

“The Giant Sword Sect’s Shi Qiyun, Masked Moon Sect’s Tang Minghua, Heavenly Imperial Fortress’ Qian Huan pays their respects to Senior . ”
