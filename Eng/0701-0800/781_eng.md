“To think of concealing yourself near the Bright Origin Lanterns . You truly are seeking death!” The woman muttered without the mind to carefully examine the results . It was enough knowing that the victim was a Heavenly South cultivator .

Ever since she ignited the ancient lanterns, she had six cultivators come after them one after another . After all, the huge bird only came into existence once the ancient lanterns were summoned, and they remained burning ever since . It took only a glance to know that there was something strange about them, so those that were skilled at concealment techniques thought to exterminate the lantern’s flames . However, not a single one of them were successful; they were all exterminated by the woman’s flames .

At that moment, Han Li was several hundred meters away from her . When he saw that the nameless cultivator had been effortlessly killed by the woman, he felt his heart shiver . He ceased his gradual approach towards the woman .

Although the woman simply muttered to herself, Han Li was able to hear her words using his astonishing spiritual sense . Han Li then turned his gaze to the ancient lanterns not far away . He rubbed his chin as he pondered to himself . They seemed to be an extraordinary existence . Not only were they able to summon that demon bird, but they also had the ability to see through concealment . It would prove truly troublesome .

Han Li’s expression wavered for a long while and his brow shifted, having finally come to a decision . He slapped his storage pouch and fished out a few items . He then glanced at a few spirit beast pouches at his waist with a smile .

At short moment later, Spell Warrior Le appeared vastly more on guard as she sat cross-legged in front of the ancient lanterns, a lotus mirage faintly visible around her . She was staring at them, fusing her spiritual sense with them and allowing her to sense any movements with a hundred meters of them .

A flash of light suddenly appeared a hundred meters away to reveal a dozen tall apes . Their bold appearance caused the woman to look at them with surprise . There was another entire row of apes standing behind the first . They all raised their arms, shooting several tens of beams of light from their hands .

“Puppets!” Spell Warrior Le was shocked, and soon frowned when she discovered that they were well-crafted . She cautiously looked around, failing to spot who was controlling the puppets .

Spell Warrior Le paid little mind to the light beam attacks . With a single incantation gesture, the lotus mirage flickered and easily blocked them . Afterwards, the woman’s body blurred and she picked off an ember of flame from one of the lanterns .

This time, the woman didn’t immediately release the ember . Rather, she kept it floating in her hand as she stared at the ancient lanterns in preparation for any strange changes .

In a mere short moment, the woman’s expression stirred and she opened her mouth, spitting out a breath of spiritual Qi onto her hand . The flame then blazed with azure light before disappearing without a trace . She turned her head and glanced at an area a hundred meters away .

With a light pop, a silhouette appeared, covered in azure light . Then with an incantation gesture, the woman willed the flames to combust, a cold grin of satisfaction appearing on her lips .

“Yi! Why are they still alive?” The woman’s smile froze and discovered that this silhouette wasn’t instantly incinerated as with the previous cultivators, nor did it show any sign of struggle .

In her alarm, she hastily examined the figure . “This person is . . . no, not a person! It’s a puppet!”

The silhouette appeared the same shape as Han Li, but its expression and body was completely stiff . Additionally, it appeared as if it weren’t being burned by the azure flames in the slightest .

“Not good!” In that instant, something immediately came to mind and she hastily turned her head to look at the ancient lanterns, reexamining her surroundings with her spiritual sense . Meanwhile, a silhouette appeared sixty meters away in a flash of azure light . Then with a ring of thunder, he disappeared in a flash of light .

When Spell Warrior Le saw this, she formed an incantation gesture with both her hands in furious alarm, striking the lanterns with successive spell seals .

However, she was too late . Lightning flashed beside the ancient lanterns, followed by the appearance of a youth . Soon after, a giant black-red hand was summoned in the air, growing to the size of three meters before fiercely swiping at the ancient lanterns .

“This person recognizes the main lantern! Only the caster could possibly know which one is the original . Even a late Nascent Soul cultivator shouldn’t be able to see through them!” When the woman saw this, she was shocked to the core .

In this short distance, the large hand and Spell Warrior Le’s spell seal struck the ancient lantern at the same time . The lantern flashed with life as it underwent a transformation, but in the process, the huge hand grabbed onto it, burning with black Yin flames in an attempt to exterminate it .

At nearly the same moment, the other eight lanterns began to tremble, disappearing one by one in a flicker of light, dissipating into wisps of smoke .

“No!” Spell Warrior Le blanched at the sight of this . With gritted teeth, she raised her hands, enveloping the black hand with a large lotus mirage in an attempt to seize back the ancient lantern . However, her attack was predicted . With the ancient lantern in its grasp, it immediately shot back without the slightest delay .

Then with a cold snort, lightning rang once more, and both the black-red hand and the silhouette disappeared . In the following moment, the silhouette re-appeared beside the puppet trapped in azure light, ancient lantern in hand . Han Li had used surprise to his greatest advantage .

“You will not leave . ” Spell Warrior Le flusteredly glanced at the azure bird and discovered that the Sacred Bird had yet to disappear . Her heart determined, she loudly screamed, enveloping her body in azure light as she chased after him in a clear wind .

Han Li’s expression grew sullen and white light flashed from his hands . With the ancient lantern placed inside his storage pouch, he unfolded his wings and disappeared to another location a hundred meters away . At the same time, the woman appeared where he originally stood, pursuing him as a transformed wind .

Han Li’s gaze stirred and he suddenly formed a hand incantation with one of his hands, uttering, “Explode . ” At that moment, the lightning bead in the puppet’s mouth ruptured . With golden lightning and azure flames intertwined, not only did over half of the puppet disintegrate, but it also caught Spell Warrior Le that was nearby .

The woman’s lotus mirage moved to protect her . Although its master acted without regard for her safety, each of the lotus petals glowed and rigidly blocked the attack .

However, the lightning bead was beyond powerful . Although she hadn’t suffered any damaged, she knocked back ten meters, dissolving her wind movement technique for a time .

Han Li sighed . Although he felt the lightning bead hadn’t reached its full potential, he blinked away once more and fled into the distance . By the time Spell Warrior Le regained her bearings, Han Li was already over three hundred meters away .

Spell Warrior Le gritted her teeth and was just about to give pursuit when the remaining half of the blown puppet began to release a monstrous sound . Having just suffered from it before, she hastily looked towards it in alarm to see it in azure light . Soon after, the remaining half of it began to scatter into swarms of tri-colored beetles .

Spell Warrior Le was forced to confront them and she hastily protected herself, shrouding her body in a white lotus . However, the tri-colored beetles instantly condensed to form several large shields that blocked her path .

Each time the woman attempted to use her wind movement technique, her casting was interrupted with wave after wave of attacks . In her immense fury, she launched series of spirit techniques to strike the beetles, only to find that they were ineffective .

At that moment, she shockingly discovered that the tri-colored beetles appeared nearly identical to the Gold Devouring Beetles apart from the specks of black on their shell . Startled, she immediately reached the the wood spirit treasure in her storage pouch to trap these flying insects, but before she could, the beetles scattered with a buzz .

The woman changed expressions several times from shock and she hastily glanced into the distance . At an unknown time, Han Li had activated a concealment technique and already disappeared without a trace . Spell Warrior Le’s complexion changed between red and white as she remained still in the air, at a complete loss of what to do .

At that same moment, the Moulan Sacred Bird just breathed out an azure fireball, destroying the protective treasure of one of the Great Truths cultivators . Just as it rejoiced and was about to shred the cultivator with its talons, it suddenly felt spiritual power wildly drain from its body .

In its shock, the bird was unable to injure the cultivator and it hastily turned its head around to discover that the ancient lantern had disappeared . The huge bird could only shriek in panic as its body quickly shrank, having instantly lost its ability to control fire spirit Qi . As for the sea of azure flames, it intensely burned for a moment more before disappearing without a trace much to the astonishment of the Seven Great Truths Cultivators .

The Yin Yang Devils transformed into a green wind as soon as they were freed and fiercely struck at the weakened azure bird . By then, the bird had already shrunk to a meter long . Its eyes were filled with resentment as it stared at the two approaching devils without the slightest intention of dodging . Before the twin devils could strike it, the bird had exploded, transforming into countless specks of azure light that soon faded away .

Once this happened, the Yin Yang Devils paused and simply stood in the sky .

“How did this happen?” One of the old men asked with joy, having escaped death . At that moment, his magic power was already drained and he was nearly defenseless .

“Look over there . It seems they’ve had some problem with the treasure they used to summon the demon bird . The ancient lantern is no longer there . ” The leading old man let out a long sigh and he swept his gaze over to where the ancient lanterns once floated . He appeared completely relieved as if he had escaped calamity . He felt as if he had been only a mere moment from death .
