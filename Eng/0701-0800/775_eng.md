The woman surnamed Le sent the ancient lantern into the sky and released a trace of white Nascent flame from her mouth, lighting the ancient lantern . With both hands forming an incantation gesture in the shape of a lotus flower, she muttered a cryptic incantation, summoning a white lotus beneath her as it slowly blossomed . It was done with such grace that she appeared otherworldly .

Her incantation was filled with an indescribably ancient aura . Then with a tremble from the bronze lantern, mirages suddenly emerged from the lamp, forming eight identical copies of itself . They then began to revolve around themselves before separating into three different circles that slowly circled around each other .

The woman surnamed Le flicked her finger striking each of the ancient lanterns with various spell seals . Azure light brightly shined, causing nine flames to simultaneously float from the lanterns, and met at the center of them, turning into a head-sized azure flame . The woman then spat out a mist of blood essence at the azure flames . The flames engulfed it, burning all the more brightly and vastly increasing in energy .

A short moment later, a clear cry echoed and a foot-long azure bird emerged from the flames . The magnificent peacock appeared graceful with long azure feathers and a pair of jewel-like, fire-red eyes . It arrogantly glanced around and tilted its neck when it saw the woman surnamed Le beneath it . It began to spoke to her in an ancient language from the time of antiquity .

After deeply saluting at the bird three times, she replied to it through voice transmission . The shriveled old man watched this with a grave expression .

Spell warrior Le stopped talking in an ancient language and she flipped her hand, taking out a pink, fragrant pearl . When the azure peacock saw this, he revealed an expression of joy and sucked it into its mouth in an azure mist .

With a crackle, a halo of light glowed azure peacock and azure flames roiled around it . As a sharp cry scream through the air, it transformed into a huge bird of flames and unfolded its wings, engulfing five kilometers of the sky in fire-attribute spiritual Qi . The cultivators and spell warriors who used fire-attribute techniques suddenly felt their power weaken, much to their alarm .

The fire spirit Qi in the air began to gather together like rivers to an ocean and poured into the azure bird’s body . As a result, it began to expand, causing the azure flames on its body to grow all the brighter .

All the cultivators within five kilometers stilled their hand and looked at the azure firebird with shock . The nearby temperatures had instantly risen . Even under the protection of magic tools, they felt as if they were beside a furnace .

But when the spell warriors saw this, they revealed an expression of joy .

“It’s the Sacred Bird! Sage Le has summoned it!”

“This battle is ours!” A few spell warriors shouted out with loud voices . Soon, they began to launch frantic attacks at the cultivators with great excitement .

The shriveled old man wore a rare smile upon seeing the might of the Sacred Bird . When the black-robed woman from the Yin Sifting Sect saw the azure peacock, a strange expression flickered from her face . She then said, “Only a Sacred Bird at Deity Transformation stage is able to control the fire spirits of heaven and earth . It is no wonder it is your most valued weapon .

However, your Sacred Bird may be powerful, but when it emerged it was only at early Nascent Soul stage . And it was only able to barely ascend to late Nascent Soul stage after absorbing all that fire spirit Qi . That should be a doppelganger of sorts . Else, the Moulan definitely wouldn’t have lost so much land against the Soaring Tribes . ”

After glancing at the black-robed woman, the shriveled old man calmly replied, “Lady Lu is no ordinary character I see! The Sacred Bird’s true body isn’t present, but that is only a small matter . Even late Nascent Soul cultivators are no match against it . ”

The black-robed woman nodded . “That’s right . Being able to absorb so much worldly spiritual power is something only Deity Transformation stage beings can do . But just this ability alone already puts it in an invincible position . ” The shriveled old man chuckled and didn’t reply .

As for the seven white-clothed old men, just as they used their various ancient treasures to strike the spell warriors, they spotted the huge bird within an azure sun and were dumbstruck .

The grey-robed old man in charge wore a grim expression and said, “Not good! That demon beast isn’t something that ordinary cultivators can withstand . We must block it . ”

Another old man responded with a lively tone, “Then what are we waiting for him . Let’s use the Seven Treasures of Great Truths to kill them . That demon bird isn’t something from this world . We cannot allow it to cast any spells . ” Soon after, he transformed into a streak of yellow light and flew straight towards the azure sun .

When the others saw him, they immediately followed his lead . As for their leader, the grey-robed old man, he appeared hesitant but followed after them as well after a sigh .

When the seven cultivators approached the azure sun, the Moulan Sacred Beast had already finished absorbing the fire spirit Qi nearby and its body grew to over eighty meters tall . It glanced down at the several cultivators with an entirely hostile expression . With a malicious glint in its eyes, it unfurled its wings and launched a barrage of fist-sized azure fireballs towards the seven .

Before the seven old men could begin their attack, they felt a wave of warm wind . Their bodies were immediately dry, but they felt their hearts tremble . Under the vast barrage azure fireballs, the old man with long eyebrows slapped his storage pouch and flung a crystalline ice net towards the fireballs . In a flash of white light, all of the fireballs had been captured by it .

When the long-eyebrowed old man saw this, he smiled, but soon his complexion paled . The ice net ruptured only after a moment, thoroughly dissolved by the azure flames that it held . In that time, the fireballs transformed into a pillar of flame and shot to the men with overbearing momentum .

“Go!” The old man in the lead swiftly released his own magic treasures, a milky-white ancient mirror . It flew out and circled once before releasing a white barrier that staved back the azure flames .

But when the others saw the ice net dissolve, they felt their breaths turn cold . They knew that common magic tools wouldn’t prove useful against an azure flame .

“Quickly use the Devil Isolating Formation . Seal that demon bird!” The leading old man shouted . When the other cultivators heard this they hastily commanded their ancient treasures .

A red club, yellow halberd, medallion, small cauldron, jade fan, and a scepter soared into the sky, surrounding the huge bird . Then after a series of clear rings, the ancient mirror transformed into a rainbow, raising a rainbow barrier that not only withstood the azure flames but also trapped the huge bird .

When the azure bird saw this, its eyes were filled with fury . It pecked downward, its beak surrounded by a dense layer of azure radiance . An instant later, a tall old man suddenly felt his medallion treasure tremble . With a huge bang, it was struck back and flew straight towards him .

In his alarm, he hurriedly struck his medallion with several spell seals in an attempt to stop its momentum, but the medallion only paused for just a moment before ruthlessly continuing onward towards the old man . But just as it was about to strike him, a silhouette suddenly blurred behind him and placed his hands on his shoulders, pouring in a huge amount of spiritual Qi into his body .

“Quickly cast the technique . I’ll lend you my strength . ” The leading old man spoke with a cold voice, rousing the tall old man’s spirits . In a single breath, the tall old man cast five spell seals and stopped the medallion from coming any closer . The two couldn’t help but sigh with relief, having regained control of it .

As this occurred, dread filled the hearts of the other old men . They became more vigilant and hurriedly exerted the utmost power of their ancient treasures . Various colored light intertwined and combined together to block the strikes from the huge bird’s light-clad beak .

Not far away, Spell Warrior Le glanced at the scene and turned her head around to look at the ancient lantern . After a moment of hesitation, she remained still . Until the lantern oil fully burned, she needed to guard it and couldn’t eliminate the cultivators attacking the Sacred Bird . Leaving the lantern alone would prove disastrous .

The shriveled old spell warrior revealed surprise when he saw the old cultivators tying down the Sacred Bird, but he didn’t seem to pay it any mind .

He wasn’t worried about the bird deity that they had worshipped with tens of thousands of years . It clearly had the advantage . Regardless of how powerful those seven magic treasures may be, they aren’t any match for the Sacred Bird . It would definitely be able to strike down the seven cultivators before the lantern oil was finished burning .

These seven should be the ultimate killers of the Heavenly South . With that thought, the shriveled old spell warrior turned his eyes to glance at Long Han, who was standing in front of an army of over a thousand cultivators with a sullen expression .

“I didn’t expect for the Moulan of being capable of summoning such a powerful demon bird . This will be troublesome . ” Long Han muttered to himself with a sullen expression . Then with a loud voice, he coldly said, “Quickly, release the Spirit Phantoms . Take advantage of moments the Seven Great Truths Cultivators are giving us and use them to great effect . ”

Soon after he gave the order, several tens of birds shining with pitch-black light flew out from the cultivator army . Additionally, there were several cultivators who took out a spirit talisman from their storage pouch and slapped it on a statue . In a flash of green light, the spirit talisman merged into the status and the cultivators immediately sat on the ground, motionless .

A short moment later, the eyes of the pitch-black phantom birds shined with a chilling blue light, and they extended their claws as much as they could before flying down to the spell warriors below . As for the cultivators who slapped the talismans on the statue, their heads began to roll as if they fell asleep .

When the shriveled old man saw this, a trace of mockery appeared on his face . He turned around to the black-robed woman and politely said, “The time has come for your esteemed self to give them the lethal blow . Lady Lu, release your Copper-armored Corpses . We can seize victory now . ” Satisfaction appeared on the shriveled old man’s face .

The black-robed woman’s eyes twinkled for a moment before she calmly said, “Brother Zhu, don’t be hastily . Let’s wait a moment more . A majority of my sect’s Copper-armored Corpses possess Foundation Establishment cultivation . So long as we wait until the Heavenly South cultivators exhausted their strength, the corpses will be able to rout them . ”

After frowning a moment, he hesitated before nodding . “This . . . Fine! So long as you don’t change your mind, we can wait a little bit more . ” He felt her words felt a bit of reason .
