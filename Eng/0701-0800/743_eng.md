It appeared the white lotus wasn’t something that was created from a treasure, but was rather something that was formed from the woman’s own magic power . Han Li was truly amazed that something this powerful was solely produced by a technique . However, this amazement only lasted for only a moment . He took a deep breath with a sullen expression and quickly raised his arm, cover it in a layer of faint black Qi .

The black Qi appeared alive as it continuously lashed around and grew thicker . By the time it became pitch-black, Han Li’s expression grew stern . His arm quickly swelled, becoming three times as thick in the blink of an eye . Soon, a layer of dazzling crimson light began to cover the black Qi in an incredibly bizarre display .

At that moment, Han Li glanced coldly at the green-robed woman, and just as it so happened, the woman also raised her head to look at him, their eyes met . Then when her eyes saw Han Li’s monstrous arm, a cold glint shined from them .

“Go!” Han Li roared and dropped his arm, releasing a semicircular mass of black-red light . Once it left his arm, it grew to the length of ten meters .

It ripped through space as remnants of light dragged behind it, instantly arriving before the white lotus .

The green-robed woman raised her brow at the sight of the Yin Devil Execution and spat out a mist of lustrous white Qi onto the lotus . In an instant, a huge lotus mirage suddenly emerged from the white lotus, enveloping both itself and the woman .

In a flash of light, the Yin Devil Execution rammed into the lotus mirage and easily cleaved into it . But after travelling ten meters deep into the mirage, it slowed down before coming to a stop .

A trace of pride appeared on the woman’s face, but soon, her expression vastly changed . At that moment, she saw Han Li fling a black object at her . As soon as it left his hand, it began to exponentially expand and overbearingly pound downwards on both woman and lotus .

“The Thousandfold Mountain!” When the woman saw this huge towering mountain, she couldn’t help but shout its name . This ancient treasure was renowned amongst spell warriors . Even if a mid Nascent Soul-stage spell warrior like her were to use a secret Buddhist technique from antiquity, they wouldn’t be able to receive an attack from the mountain unscathed .

The green-robed woman formed a hand incantation without a further thought, immersing the white lotus above her, the small yellow cauldron, and herself in a fusion of white light . In an instant, the air surrounding the lotus became completely still before suddenly erupting with azure radiance . The woman came into view once more .

Despite no longer being sustained by the woman’s magic power, the lotus mirage grew dim and didn’t immediately fade away . It managed to last for a short moment before being completely scattered by the descending mountain .

Revealing not the slightest joy from his face, Han Li muttered, “Wind Movement Technique?” He then began to inwardly curse . He didn’t expect that this woman would be capable of a strange movement technique on par with his lightning movement . In this case, he wouldn’t be able to harm her unless he somehow trapped her .

He had managed to come up with a plan, but he felt unsure of it . She was as skilled with her wind movement technique as he was with his Thunderstorm wings . So long as he managed to keep up with her, he was confident that he would be able to easily wound her with the fearsomeness of the Celestial Ice Flames .

With that thought, Han Li raised his hands and pointed to the black-red light and the tens of Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords that had finally escaped their restraints . Quickly, they fiercely shot towards where the green-robed woman had appeared . Thunder then roared from behind Han Li and silver wings appeared from his back .

As for his Bluelight Shield, he waved both his arms and it quickly shrunk before flying back into Han Li’s sleeve . At that same moment, the huge black-red hand relaxed its grip on the white ribbon hawk, and it streaked towards the woman in a ball of black light .

But that was not the end of his preparations . He raised his arms once more, but this time, a blue flame emerged from his palm . It crackled with a wavering blue brilliance .

Finally, Han Li took it upon himself to personally close in on her, having done what he could to restrict her movements . In a flash of silver lightning, he disappeared, leaving only rolls of thunder in his wake .

When the woman saw Han Li release so many treasures in a single display, she felt her head suddenly ache . She originally believed that this measly early Nascent Soul cultivator’s power only extended to a few strange abilities . So long as these abilities were restrained, she should be able to smoothly deal with him .

But she didn’t expect that in a single move, he would unleash several powerful treasures in succession . In comparison, the only treasure she released had been restrained by her opponent . As someone who was used to being revered amongst the spell warriors, this embarrassment had given rise to fury . However, the woman clearly understood that since he possessed so many treasures, it would be difficult to injure him with ordinary techniques and treasures, let alone kill him .

When she saw Han Li flap his wings and disappear in a flash of lightning, she snorted and eventually came to a decision to exhaust a bit of her strength and finish Han Li off with one of her killing moves .

Of course, she couldn’t allow Han Li to easily approach her during this time . As she pondered this, the white lotus had dropped down onto her head and disappeared into her body . Just as this happened, Han Li’s figure appeared about ten meters away from the woman’s body in a flash of lightning .

With a blur of his body, he suddenly appeared three meters away from her and hastily extended his cackling blue palm against the yellow barrier that surrounded the woman’s body .

Han Li was confident that the wood attribute barrier placed by the cauldron would be broken by the Celestial Ice Flames . And his attack smoothly succeeded . However, the woman remained still and showed no indication that she was going to use her wind evasion technique . An unease filled his heart as a shiver spread across his back .

At that moment, the woman suddenly shined with a soft white radiance as lotus petal mirages blossomed from her body . And against expectation, the faint yellow light barrier that Han Li just struck had actually managed to withstand his attack . Just as the white light and the blue flames made contact, Han Li felt his entire arm tremble .

In the instant that the white brilliance shined, the lotus petals began to sweep towards him . Although they appeared slow, he wasn’t able to evade their attacks, and he could only helplessly stare as the petal struck his body .

Astonished, Han Li was struck back, a wave of pain assailing his chest .

He was launched a hundred meters away before he managed to barely stop himself, his body swaying . He glanced at the woman with alarm as he held his hand against his chest .

He glanced up and saw the green-robed woman was now standing above a lotus that spanned ten meters wide . White lotus petals were slowly fluttering all around her, and the woman herself was coldly staring at Han Li .

The treasures he had launched to attack her, they had been easily stopped by the pedals surrounding her . They were far more powerful than the lotus mirage from before .

At that moment, Han Li suddenly felt his throat become hot and he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood . He wryly smiled in his mind . He had suffered quite a bit in that exchange .

Han Li then spat out the turbulent Qi in his body and slowly moved his palm away from his chest . He glanced down at his chest to see that his robes were already shattered, revealing a tri-colored luster that laid underneath . The battle armor had a huge dent in it with thumb-sized cracks on it .

Han Li felt his breath turn cold, and the pain he felt from his chest became far sharper . With a gloomy face, he raised his head to look at the green-robed woman . As a result, he saw both astonishment and disappointment from her face when she laid her eyes on his armor .

He coldly snorted and tore away at the remnants of his robe, revealing the beetle armor in its entirety . Then in an azure flash of light, he swept his hand across the armor, and repaired it with an unbelievable speed to its original condition .

Shock appeared for just a moment on the woman’s face, but her cold demeanor was soon restored as her killing intent against Han Li only grew stronger . Without further thought, she placed her palm against her chest and began to utter a cryptic incantation . A ball of azure light then flew out of her sleeve and dropped into her hand .

The light faded away to reveal an azure oil lamp of ancient and worn condition . It appeared even slightly blackened . The green-robed woman looked at the lamp with a faint reluctance to use it, but then she turned her eyes to fiercely glare at Han Li .

This scene left Han Li with a slight sense of dread . He didn’t know what kind of ancient treasure this bronze lamp was, and this was the first time he ever saw a treasure lamp . Various thoughts quickly passed by his mind before he decided to fly into the sky and recall his treasures . Then with a flap of his wings he disappeared .

He reappeared in front of the frozen ribbon hawk, and bluntly took it into his hand before disappearing once more, reappearing on the border of the dense mist .

The green-robed woman’s mouth dropped in amazement . Ever since she ascended to her current cultivation, she encountered many fearsome opponents that had been her match, but this was the first time she saw a high grade cultivator turn tail and run .

But when she saw Han Li take her ribbon hawk with him, she awoke from her stupor with fury . Grasping onto the lamp, she glided through the air on the white lotus, closely following him in a breeze . Afterwards, she entered the dense fog and disappeared without a trace .

Immediately afterwards, azure light flashed with each appearance of silver lightning, closely chasing after it . The sounds of thunder and wind intertwined . In an instant, Han Li lured the green-robed woman into an unfamiliar area of the formation .

It was there that Han Li stopped and glanced at the frozen ribbon hawk in his hand . With a cold chuckle, golden lightning flashed from his hand and shattered it .
