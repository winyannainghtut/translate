Nangong Wan’s scarlet moon was lagging behind in its attempt to chase her Senior Martial Sister . Her Senior Martial Sister arced up towards the ceiling of the hall and fiercely struck it .

With a muffled thump, a red light pulsed from the ceiling, but it was unbroken; only a few loose pieces of rock had fallen down .

The icy woman was stunned . Before she realized what had happened, the roof flashed with light and swarms of black, gold, and silver beetles emerge from it . With a buzz, they quickly gathered at the room’s center and formed a tri-colored shield .

In the icy woman’s alarm, she waved her hand without any further thought, summoning a silver talisman in between her fingers .

When Nangong Wan saw this, she naturally knew what her Senior Martial Sister planned to do . Her expression immediately sank and slapped her storage pouch rather than using the Divine Incarnation Light . A small red flag appeared in her hand and she immediately flung it into the ground .

The icy woman waved her hand and activated the talisman in her hand . The talisman flew from her hand enveloped in a ball of yellow light and streaked towards the ceiling like a shooting star . The yellow light broke through the huge shield as if nothing had been there and directly flew towards the hall’s ceiling .

But at that same moment, Nangong Wan had finished uttering an incantation and activated the hidden restrictions in her cave residence . The entire hall began to glow with a red light, surrounding all the surfaces in a barrier of blinding light, the ceiling included .

As if a nemesis of the icy woman’s shooting star, the shooting star immediately stopped moving once it struck the light barrier as if sealed onto it . A large expanse of red light then gathered and wrapped around it .

Nangong Wan’s Senior Martial Sister was astonished by this sudden change, but as a greatly experienced cultivator, she immediately realized what restriction this was . She immediately flicked her finger with a sullen expression, launching a bone-chillingly icy white swordstreak from her hand . It circled once around the enveloped talisman and quickly scattered the red light that imprisoned it .

The icy woman was delighted at the sight . In a flash of yellow light, she immediately flew towards the ceiling through the opening of the scattered red light .

But as soon as she arrived halfway through the restriction, purple light suddenly flashed before her . Something suddenly enveloped her and forcefully dragged her away from hall’s ceiling .

With a light chuckle, a white silhouette appeared in a blur, revealing a white-clothed young woman . Silvermoon suddenly appeared from the ceiling and grasped a translucent purple thread in her hand . The other end of the purple thread led directly towards the icy woman’s body .

At that moment, Nanlong Wan’s Senior Martial Sister discovered that her body was enveloped in a net of sparkling purple thread . The thread was nearly invisible to the eye .

In the icy woman’s furious alarm, she flicked her fingers without any further thought, shooting over ten streaks of black-white sword Qi . Soon after, she followed up by spitting out a dense green flame from her mouth onto the purple net .

Purple light flourished from the net . But regardless of whether it be the green flame or the black-white sword Qi, they were incapable of harming the purple thread in the slightest .

The icy woman became truly flustered by the sight . Just as she resolved herself to consume a great amount of vitality to employ a secret technique, Silvermoon smiled and pulled on the purple thread, uttering the word, “Restrain . ”

The originally loose net immediately tightened and completely fettered the icy woman, completely preventing her from making even the slightest movement .

The woman’s face grew blood-red . Ever since she condensed a Nascent Soul, she had always been looked up to with respect . She had never been caught in a situation such as this one, especially ever since she entered mid Nascent Soul stage . With shameful fury, a cold glint appeared in her eyes as her entire body magnificently shined with light . In a moment, the light violently surged to double its size and began to faintly contain a faint tinge of crimson .

When Silvermoon saw this, her smile disappeared and she knew things wouldn’t end well . But just as she commanded the Purple Cloudlace to release all of its Jadesun True Fire, Nangong Wan sent her a voice transmission, “Do not harm her . Leave her to me!” As soon as she said this, her vermillion moon flew up from below and covered the icy woman within it .

The moon hurriedly revolved and it soon began to ripple, filling the hall with silhouettes of itself .

As Han Li stared at the twirling moon from down below, he was shocked to find his mind completely shaken and his focus broken . It was no wonder why the icy woman felt so fearful towards Nangong Wan’s Divine Incarnation Light .

After the moon revolved for the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Nangong Wan finally stopped; her face pale from exhaustion .

Then with a wave of her hand, the vermillion moon scattered into starlight with a light bang . Her Senior Martial Sister reappeared from within it as she floated in the air, still restrained by the Purple Cloudlace . However, the spiritual Qi in her body grew completely calm and she remained unconscious with a strange smile on her face .

“What’s this?” Han Li bewilderedly said .

With a bit of color returned to her face, Nangong Wan smiled, “Those trapped by my Divine Incarnation Light are incapable of escaping it, even if they manifest their Nascent Soul . This technique also possesses an incredibly powerful bewitchment effect . My Senior Martial Sister’s mind had been lost to the divine light for a time being . This way, we are able to spare her . ”

Han Li rubbed his nose and helplessly said, “It was no surprise your Senior Martial Sister was so fearful of it . It is able to prevent even a Nascent Soul from manifesting . However, there would’ve been no need to go through such troublesome methods if we didn’t need to keep her alive . Lethal methods would’ve been far easier . ”

Nangong Wan sighed and forced a smile, “Exterminating my Senior Martial Sister, the sect’s grand elder, is unacceptable! Since I plan on following you, the Masked Moon Sect will already suffer a blow to its strength . It we kill her as well, the sect will become crippled . The past Masked Moon Sect Grand Elder had treated me with great kindness . Although I cannot sacrifice myself for the sect, I cannot bring myself to doom it to extinction . ”

Han Li wryly smiled and said, “But your Senior Martial Sister sure didn’t treat you leniently when she attacked you and restricted you .

“That doesn’t matter . Since I’ve spared her life, I can consider the debt to the sect’s previous master repaid . I won’t feel uneasy later when I’ve left with you . However, the last battle was truly dangerous . I truly didn’t know that Senior Martial Sister had a heaven-defying devilish artifact such as the Blood Devil Sword . It nearly led to a disastrous outcome . Had I known of this earlier . . . ” Nangong Wan brightly flickered and she wore an apologetic expression .

However, Han Li simply smiled and showed not the slightest concern of it, “It’s nothing . Wasn’t the Blood Devil Sword incapable of harming me either way? Anyhow, let’s quickly acquire the restriction medallion and leave!”

Nangong Wan nodded her head in response . Silvermoon obediently shook her hand the unraveled the Purple Cloudlace from the icy woman .

Nangong Wan took several steps forward and bluntly tapped several places on her Senior Martial Sister’s body, placing several restrictions on top of it . She then reached out for the dark green storage pouch at her waist and gently shook it open . Then in a bright flash of light, a pile of items appeared on the floor .

When Han Li saw this, he curiously walked over .

The Heart Constraining Restriction Medallion was quite easy to find . Nangong Wan quickly took it into her hands with a smile .

As for Han Li, he quickly swept his gaze past the pile and suddenly beckoned a small exquisite ring into his hands . It was completely dark and lightless . Han Li frowned and brought the item to his eye and began to examine it .

Nangong Wan astonishedly said, “What are you doing with that? It looks like just an ordinary magic tool . ”

Han Li chuckled and suddenly slapped his storage pouch, summoning a jade box into his hands . The box then opened in a flash of azure light, revealing an identical jet-black ring .

“Yi!” Nangong Wan couldn’t help but yelp in surprise .

Han Li brought the two rings together and felt that they both possess a similar absence of Qi . He then placed both of the rings back in the box before placing it into his storage pouch .

Nangong Wan sweetly smiled and said nothing else as her mind began to wander . Then paying no further attention to the large pile of items, she walked towards her Senior Martial Sister . With a flash of red light glowing from her hand, Nangong Wan nimbly touched her Senior Martial Sister’s head before closing her eyes in silence .

When Han Li saw this, he silently walked over with a faint smile on his face .

A short moment later, Nangong Wan opened her eyes and raised her hand, revealing the Blood Devil Sword in her grasp .

Nangong Wan glanced at the sword for only a moment before tossing the devilish artifact to Han Li, “This devilish artifact is mighty and proves to be a great threat against us so it’d be best to take it with us . While I am incapable of using this item, you are able to restrain this treasure with your golden lightning . Let’s leave it in your hands!”
