Han Li rejoiced at seeing the bronze lantern seized, much to the green-robed woman’s despair . In an instant, her face paled with an expression of furious alarm . Soon after, she raised her arms, sweeping a white mist around her . The white lotus below her began to wildly revolve, producing a lotus mirage that appeared as large as a mountain .

Once the white light holding the lantern returned to the cloud, the huge lotus mirage had already launched after it in pursuit . The purple cloud then transformed into a large purple net and dropped down . In the next instant, the lotus struck the net, releasing a glow of purple and white light . Silvermoon’s sweet chuckle soon followed .

After the purple net was released, the white light faded away to reveal Silvermoon . She laughed as she held onto the ancient flower basket . Its interior shined with white light as it rigidly trapped the bronze lantern . Once the green-robed woman’s spiritual sense was wiped from it, it would be capable of being used by anyone .

But before Han Li could bask in his excitement, a silhouette staggered towards them and spotted both Han Li and the green-robed woman engaged in battle . The silhouette shouted to Han Li in panic, “Fellow Daoist Han, quickly run! A Moulan Divine Sage has arrived . He’s already killed Fellow Daoist Lu . Hurry and run!” This silhouetted turned out to be Old Man Ma, but his hair was disheveled and one of his arms was missing .

“A Moulan Divine Sage?” Han Li felt his heart drop upon hearing this . Just as he thought to ask further of the matter, Old Man Ma flew away in a flash of white light, not daring to stay a moment longer . But at that moment, an indifferent man’s voice soon arrived .

“You’re too late! I’ve already found you . You had abandoned your arm to escape calamity, but let’s see what other secret techniques you have . Surely you didn’t refine a substitution puppet out of your other arm as well? If that’s the case, I will truly hold you in admir— Yi!? Is this not the bright essence lantern? You cunning scoundrel, your courage is quite great . A little fox such as yourself dares to take a lineage treasure of the Moulan?” The words were spoken in quick succession and the speaker of the voice soon arrived before them .

A silver streak of light shot out from the sea of mist in a seemingly slow manner, but it instantly arrived before Silvermoon .

Silvermoon’s complexion grew deathly pale and she hastily waved her arm, summoning a purple net in front of her . At that same moment, she instantly took off without a further thought .

The silver streak paused for just a moment before immediately transforming into a large silver hand . It forcibly took the Purple Cloudlace in its grasp and formed a fist before striking at the air in the direction that Silvermoon had fled .

As Silvermoon flew off in a streak of yellow light, she was suddenly struck by a silver ball of light out of seemingly nowhere . With a miserable wail, her yellow light disappeared and she felt from the sky . But in her cunning, she gritted her teeth and bore through the pain, throwing the ancient flower basket towards Han Li in a streak of white light .

“You’re courting death!” The man’s voice grew furious and in a flicker of light, the silver hand split into two with one chasing the flower basket, and the other chasing after the falling Silvermoon in an attempt to crush her . The action was conducted as swiftly as a flash of lightning .

Silvermoon turned pale with fright and she hastily attempted to draw on her magic power to escape . However, silver light flashed from her body and she found herself incapable of drawing any of her magic power . That surprise strike from before had not only heavily injured her, but it had placed a simple restriction on her body . Although it could be easily broken, she was caught by surprise and didn’t have the time to dispel it .

The huge silver hand approached her with the momentum of a falling mountain, and she felt her heart tremble . She could only shut her eyes as she waited for death, but at that moment, she heard thunder roar behind her . With an arm holding her by the waist, she had somehow escaped from the silver hand’s grasp .

“We’re going!” Han Li made a clear appearance before disappearing from sight with Silvermoon in tow . The huge silver hand had missed its mark by just a sliver .

In the next moment, Han Li appeared a hundred meters away at the edge of the mist with a sullen expression . He carried Silvermoon in one hand, and the huge sword blazing with azure and purple flames in the other .

“Yi! Lightning movement!” An astonished voice came from the huge silver hand . As for the other hand, it returned with the flower basket in its grasp . The two silver hands then combined together in a brilliant glow of light, disappearing to reveal a middle-aged spell warrior in scholar robes . He held onto the Purple Cloudlace with one hand, and he grabbed the ancient flower basket with the other . He was examining Han Li in the distance with a calm expression .

When Old Man Ma had seen this person appear, his face became deathly pale, and despite the light that continuously pulsed from his body, he didn’t dare to flee .

Han Li’s gaze flickered as he carefully examined the very first late Nascent Soul-stage cultivator he had seen for the first time . Apart from the few sparse cultivators that manage to reach Deity Transformation stage, late Nascent Soul stage cultivators were peak existances in the cultivation world .

At that moment, the middle-aged spell warrior glanced around and spotted the green-robed woman surnamed Le . With a wave of his hand, he tossed the ancient flower basket containing the bronze lantern towards her .

“Many thanks for Divine Sage Zhong’s assistance . Had Brother Zhong not come . . . ” The green-robed woman was delighted that she managed to regain possession of the bronze lamp and felt immense relief . Even as arrogant and cold as she may be, she was facing one of the three Moulan Divine Sages, and she didn’t dare to offend him in the slightest .

The scholarly middle-aged man calmly said, “It’s nothing . I’ve simply heard that the Heavenly South cultivators were sending reinforcements towards this grand formation . After hearing about Heavenweep’s death, I grew somewhat worried and came over to take a look . It’d be best to give those from the State of Great Jin a reasonable explanation as we are currently intertwined with them . But since our enemy is capable of using lightning movement, it is no wonder even Sage Le has a problem dealing with him . ”

Afterwards, he turned to look at Han Li and asked, “That small fox is yours? It is quite courageous to dare to act against our Moulan’s lineage treasure . Since you’re her master, then I’d best deal with the both of you . ”

Han Li narrowed his eyes and took a deep breath . He snorted and icily replied, “Your tone is quite arrogant, but even if we didn’t touch that lantern, would you still let us go free? I don’t know if you have the skill to take my life . ”

When the scholarly man heard this, his gaze swept past the huge sword in Han Li’s hand . His face revealed astonishment upon seeing the azure and purple flames tangle against one another, but soon, he chuckled as if he hadn’t seen it . “It has been many years since a cultivator dared to say that in front of me . Sage Le, I’ll hand that one-armed cultivator over there to you . As for our young friend capable of lightning movement, I’ll be personally dealing with him . Let’s see just how long he can last . ”

Ruthless intent revealed from the man’s face as his body suddenly blurred and silver light flashed from both his sides . Suddenly, two exact replicas of the scholarly man appeared at his side with the exact same clothes and face . They both stared at Han Li as if he were already dead .

Han Li felt his breath run cold . He quickly swept his spiritual sense and couldn’t find any difference between the two incarnations and the original . Be it their aura of cultivation or appearance, they were completely the same . Despite the dread he felt in his heart, Han Li patted Silvermoon’s shoulder and quickly whispered something to her .

Silvermoon obediently nodded . Having already dispelled the restriction on her body, she returned to the form of a small fox in a flash of white light and swiftly entered Han Li’s sleeve .

At that moment, the three scholarly men swept their sleeves and slowly made their way towards Han Li . Their movements clearly appeared relaxed, but in a matter of only three steps, they had already arrived only thirty meters away from Han Li .

With a vastly changed expression, Han Li flapped his wings without another moment of thought and disappeared from sight .

“You want to leave, but where can you run?” The middle of the three scholarly men said with a chuckle . Afterwards, the three of them flickered with silver light, and pursued him with a relaxed stride . With two steps taken in the air, the three of them also disappeared .

When the pale Old Man Ma saw this, he suddenly lept away at great speed, wordlessly transforming into a streak of white light as he tore through the skies .

The green-robed woman sneered at the sight of this and formed an incantation gesture with her hands before chasing after him in a breeze of wind . She no longer had any worry of Han Li, knowing that a Divine Sage was chasing after him . Additionally, this old cultivator wasn’t capable of lightning movement, so he definitely wouldn’t be able to escape her . As for the grand formation in the area, it was hardly effective against a Nascent Soul cultivator . Its restrictions were easily swept away .

. . .

In a empty wilderness with a darkened sky, claps of thunder echoed through the air with flashes of silver light, each flash revealing the figure of a distraught Han Li . He was hurriedly glancing behind him with an expression of resentment .

“Silvermoon, how many days have we fled?”

Silvermoon’s voice worriedly spoke in Han Li’s mind, “It should be about four days already . If master rests for more than a few minutes, this late Nascent Soul-stage cultivator will immediately catch up . Is there truly no way to escape his spiritual sense mark? This is far too dangerous . Although you have the Myriad Year Spirit Milk to restore your magic power, you’ve almost exhausted your Divine Devilbane Lightning . Without the lightning movement, you won’t be able to escape his pursuit and movements . Such profound abilities are on par with instantaneous movement itself; there are hardly any differences to be said . Were it not for Master’s shrewdness to completely avoid fighting and continuously flee, we would’ve been tangled down without a method of escape . ”

Han Li wryly smiled and resentfully said, “The trace of a late Nascent Soul-stage spiritual sense can be tracked down by a couple hundred of kilometers . Although my own spiritual sense is beyond that of a mid Nascent Soul-stage cultivator, it is still quite lacking to a true late Nascent Soul-stage cultivator . After all, I didn’t learn the Great Development Technique to completion . I haven’t been able to get my hands on the last layers of the technique . Once this chase ends, I’ll immediately head to the far west and find the final layers of that chant with certainty . In the past, I’ve never had this problem because my spiritual sense was always superior to my opponents . But now, my hands are tied and I find myself helpless in spite of whatever methods I use . ”
