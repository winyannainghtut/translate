All of a sudden, a layer of black Qi erupted out of the grey-robed man's body, and his outstretched arm immediately completely shriveled up.

However, at the same time, nine different types of law fluctuations erupted out of the arm before fusing as one.

His shriveled arm pierced into the golden giant's waist, and once most of the arm had been plunged into Ma Liang's body, it abruptly exploded.

A burst of nine-colored flames erupted forth, instantly inundating the golden giant's entire body and setting it alight.

The golden giant roared with agony, and its blood and flesh were quickly stripped away by the nine-colored flames.

The colors of the flames were very distinctly separated, but were also somehow in perfect harmony, and it contained nine different types of powers of laws.

After successfully landing the surprise attack, Xuan Jiuling vanished on the spot before appearing beside Ming Zun with a cold smile on his face. "In the face of my Nine Tribulation Spirit Vanquishing Arts, even a true immortal is no match."

Even though he had detonated one of his own arms, he was extremely pleased to have slain a true immortal.

At this moment, the layer of black flames around the golden giant finally faded, and the rusty black lamp up above exploded into specks of spiritual light.

It turned out that this was a disposable treasure that could only be used once.

Yin Gangzi and the others were naturally ecstatic to see this, and all felt as if they had just survived a massive ordeal.

A faint smile also appeared on Ming Zun's face as he appraised the golden giant, which had been completely set alight.

The most fearsome part of the Nine Tribulation Spirit Vanquishing Arts were these Nine Tribulation True Flames.

The flames contained the bonded flames of nine types of fire-attribute true spirits, as nine different types of powers of laws were absorbed through other means. Just a tiny speck of this fire would be capable of evaporating oceans and melting entire mountains.

Even if the most formidable beings in the True Immortal Realm were to come into contact with these flames, they wouldn't be able to escape without at least suffering severe injuries, let alone this true immortal.

It seemed that there would be no need to unleash the other trump card that had been prepared.

As these thoughts flashed through Ming Zun's mind, the golden giant had fallen completely silent, and its flesh had been completely stripped away, leaving only a massive golden skeleton in its place.

Everyone heaved a collective internal sigh of relief upon seeing this.

However, the woman in the palatial dress suddenly yelled in a panicked manner, "Hold on, he's not actually dead! The power of this Myriad Spirit Blood Seal hasn't faded in the slightest!"

Yin Gangzi and the others were very alarmed to hear this, and they immediately directed their attention upward.

High up in the sky, the blue ice on the surface of the giant seal was still being quickly melted away by the two types of flames, and there was only a very thin layer of ice left.

"Quick! Attack him again!" Ming Zun yelled as his expression darkened significantly, and he made a hand seal before opening his mouth to release a blue flying dagger that was several inches in length. The dagger then transformed into a streak of light that was over 100 long before hurtling directly toward the golden skeleton.

Meanwhile, a hint of incredulity flashed through Xuan Jiuling's eyes, and he immediately swept a sleeve through the air, releasing hundreds of streaks of silver light that pierced through space and reached the golden skeleton in a flash before plunging toward it as hundreds of silver flying swords.

All of a sudden, a suit of beautiful crystalline armor appeared over the golden skeleton's body, and countless purplish-golden runes emerged on the suit of armor. All of the oncoming attacks struck the crystalline armor, only to immediately be sent flying without being able to damage the runes at all.

The four Mythical Black Beasts could naturally see that the situation had taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and they immediately released another black fireball each while flying back in retreat.

The black fireballs struck the purplish-golden runes and exploded violently, but were also completely ineffective.

Right at this moment, a burst of sinister cackling rang out, and the golden skeleton suddenly opened its mouth to release a palm-sized dark green vial before pointing a finger at the vial, upon which it instantly vanished.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted above the golden skeleton, and a massive vial projection that was around an acre in size appeared.

The projection tipped itself over, and a burst of green liquid gushed out of its opening before descending from the heavens like falling rain.

The rain seemed to encompass quite a large area, but in reality, it only fell upon a small area, at the center of which was the golden skeleton.

The golden skeleton paid no heed to the oncoming attacks and let loose a low roar before spreading its arms open as if he were trying to stretch to its maximal armspan.

As soon as the spirit rain fell upon the golden skeleton, a layer of green spiritual light appeared over it, following which a series of crimson threads appeared on all of its bones before quickly transforming into chunks of flesh.

Within the span of just a few breaths, the golden giant's body had recovered to normal, upon which it abruptly opened its eyes.

At the same time, a sinister smile appeared on its face, and it made a grabbing motion to draw the small green vial in the sky back into its grasp.

As a result, the giant vial projection disappeared, and the spirit rain also subsided.

"I didn't think that you had an Origin Restriction Lamp and the Nine Tribulation Spirit Vanquishing Arts up your sleeves; it looks like I underestimated you. However, all of you've managed to do here is completely enraged me. I won't afford you any chances for survival now; everyone here is going to die, and no one can escape," the golden giant roared as it made a hand seal before opening its mouth, releasing countless purplish-golden runes that instantly vanished into thin air.

In the next instant, bright golden light appeared in the sky, and a series of head-sized balls of golden light emerged. The golden giant began to chant an incantation, and the balls of light swelled drastically in size at the giant's behest.

At the same time, the dormant golden volcanoes down below began to release bursts of golden lava once again, quickly transforming the earth into a world of golden lava.

The golden light and golden lava began to converge between heaven and earth, and Ming Zun immediately shot back in retreat as a streak of blue light as he yelled, "Run! He's about to attack using his spirit domain!"

The four Mythical Black Beasts had already fled as four balls of black light, and Xuan Jiuling gritted his teeth before vanishing on the spot as a faint shadow.

Yin Gangzi and Mistress Wu Ling's hearts completely sank upon seeing this, and they naturally fled for their lives as well.

The giant silver hands and huge yellow mace in the sky vanished, and Yin Gangzi crashed heavily down onto the ground like a shooting star before plunging into the earth and fleeing using an earth movement technique.

Meanwhile, a pair of grey bat wings appeared on Mistress Wu Ling's back amid a flash of black light, and she flapped her wings vigorously, flying away as a gust of wind.

The woman in the palatial dress hurriedly attempted to unleash an evasion technique as well, but it was already too late.

A burst of rumbling rang out from the crimson seal in the sky, and what remained of the layer of blue ice immediately shattered, following which the seal descended from above like lightning.

The space around the woman tightened once again, and she was completely immobilized. She desperately released all of her treasures in a frenzy, forming layer upon layer of protective spiritual light, but all of those treasures were instantly destroyed by a burst of crimson light released by the giant seal, and in the next instant, the woman was completely erased out of existence.

In the face of the Myriad Spirit Blood Seal's almighty power, not only had she been reduced to nothingness, all of her treasures had been destroyed as well.

"None of you are going anywhere!" the golden giant harrumphed coldly as purplish-golden light flashed from his arm, and he pointed a finger toward a certain direction.

The golden light around the giant's body immediately reared up as a gargantuan golden wave before crashing down to sweep up the fleeing Ming Zun, Xuan Jiuling, and Mistress Wu Ling into the spirit domain.

At the same time, spatial fluctuations erupted near the edge of the spirit domain, and the four Mythical Black Beasts stumbled out of thin air with alarmed expressions.

Before the seven of them had a chance to react, seven gigantic hands that were riddled with purplish-golden patterns appeared beneath them before locking tightly around their bodies.

A burst of power of laws then descended upon them, and not only were they completely immobilized, their magic power had also completely congealed.

The seven of them were naturally petrified by this development, and right at this moment, seven identical crimson seal projections appeared above them before descending from the heavens.

After nothing more than a brief flash of crimson light, the three Grand Ascension Stage beings and four Mythical Black Beasts were all reduced to nothingness.

Meanwhile, Yin Gangzi was tens of thousands of feet underground, but he was surrounded by eight golden underground volcanoes and completely immobilized.

The eight volcanoes erupted in unison amid a burst of loud rumbling, and Yin Gangzi was instantly inundated by scorching golden lava.

An anguished howl rang out from within the golden lava, and that was followed by complete silence.

A pleased look appeared on the golden giant's face upon witnessing the demise of its enemies, but its expression then suddenly darkened as it turned toward a certain direction. "Who's there? Come out right now!"

As soon as its voice trailed off, another giant golden hand appeared out of thin air in that direction before swooping down from above, forcibly wrenching a miniature purplish-golden figure out of thin air.

The miniature figure had no facial features aside from a pair of glowing eyes, and even though it had been caught by the giant golden hand, it wasn't panicked in the slightest as it appraised the golden giant in an emotionless manner.

"That's a Gold Devouring Immortal!" the golden giant exclaimed as a stunned look appeared on its face.
