Golden and blue runes immediately surged out of his body in a frenzy, following which bright golden light erupted forth before a layer of blue flames appeared, from within which specks of golden light then emerged.

Thus, the golden light and blue flames transitioned between one another over and over again, instantly forming countless layers over Ma Liang's body.

The transitions were taking place so quickly that even all of the Grand Ascension Stage beings were struggling to keep up with their eyes.

Wary looks immediately appeared on everyone's faces, and a cold look also flashed through Ming Zun's eyes.

Right at this moment, the light around Ma Liang's body settled on a shimmering golden color, and he took a step forward, upon which his body swelled to several times its original size, transforming into a golden giant that was over 10,000 feet tall.

At the same time, he made a hand seal, and golden spirit patterns appeared all over his skin, while countless specks of golden light appeared in the surrounding area.

All of a sudden, another burst of power of laws filled the entire sky, and it clashed with the power of laws of the Bipolar Destruction Formation.

As a result, the formation was thrown into complete disarray, and not only was most of its power nullified, it was only just barely able to hold itself together.

"This is a spirit domain! How is he able to unleash a spirit domain in this realm? This is impossible! How can he do this in the face of the restrictive power of this realm?" Mistress Wu Ling exclaimed with an incredulous expression.

Yin Gangzi and the others had naturally also identified this spirit domain, and fearful looks had appeared on all of their faces.

The fact that Ma Liang was able to unleash this ability indicated that he had already returned to the height of his powers and was no longer being restricted by the power of this realm.

All of the Grand Ascension Stage beings present were quite proud, but they knew in their hearts that there was no way they could contend with an unrestricted true immortal.

"Hehe, this is not a true spirit domain. Having said that, you'll be able to witness my spirit domain soon. If you have any trump cards left, then use them now. Otherwise, you won't get any further chances," the golden giant said in a rumbling voice. Immediately thereafter, it pointed a finger up at the sky, and a golden pillar of light erupted from its fingertip before vanishing into the heavens in a flash.

In the next instant, the entire space tremored violently, and the specks of golden light exploded to illuminate the entire sky with scintillating golden light.

The earth down below also tremored violently as a series of golden rifts opened up, and one golden volcano after another quickly emerged from the rifts. Golden lava came gushing out in a frenzy, and in the blink of an eye, the entire world seemed to have been transformed into a golden sea.

Everyone's hearts immediately sank even further upon seeing this.

Ming Zun's expression also darkened significantly, but he immediately yelled, "There's no need to fear, fellow daoists. I don't know how he's able to unleash this spirit domain, but there's no way he can maintain it for too long. Otherwise, he would've unleashed it right away rather than wasting all this time."

Everyone else felt this to be quite a reasonable analysis, but they were still quite hesitant as they exchanged glances with one another.

Meanwhile, the golden giant stood still on the spot with his eyes shut, seemingly drawing upon its magic power.

At the same time, the golden domain was expanding in all directions at a rate that was discernible even to the naked eye, forcing everyone to rush back in retreat in fear of being swept up in the spirit domain.

Yin Gangzi steadied himself before transmitting his voice toward Ming Zun.

"With his current power, we could easily perish at any moment if we were to engage him in battle; isn't it about time you brought out some other trump cards, Brother Ming? Don't tell me that this Bipolar Annihilation Formation is the only trump card you prepared."

"Rest assured, Fellow Daoist Yin, I won't just stand by idly and watch while he does as he pleases. I've prepared two countermeasures against spirit domains; I wouldn't ask you to give your lives for nothing," Ming Zun replied.

As soon as his voice trailed off, he took a deep breath before making a hand seal, and a total of 81 black crystal balls flew out of his sleeves before revolving through the air and blooming like a cluster of giant black flowers.

These black flowers then formed a massive black light formation that expanded in a frenzy to encompass all of the Grand Ascension Stage beings, and it kept the golden light radiating from the spirit domain at bay, preventing it from expanding any further.

At the same time, black runes surged incessantly within the black light formation alongside bursts of Buddhist chants that struck the listener with a sense of indescribable comfort and entrancement.

The woman in the palatial dress was both stunned and ecstatic to see this. "This is the Buddhist River Paradise Domain! Isn't this a paramount Buddhist protective treasure? How did it end up in your hands?"

"Hehe, our trade guild obtained this treasure by chance. It can't compare with that true immortal's spirit domain, but it'll be enough to protect all of us for now. If this isn't enough, I have another measure up my sleeve," Ming Zun replied.

After a brief moment of contemplation, a determined look appeared on the black-armored man's mangled face, and he said, "In that case, I'll stay and take a risk; it'll be worth making a gamble for the chance to kill this true immortal."

"I'll stay as well, but if it turns out that we're no match for this opponent, then I'm not going to remain here and throw away my life for nothing," Mistress Wu Ling said in a cold voice.

Yin Gangzi and the others remained silent, but it was clear that they were also planning to test out the power of this spirit domain before making their decision.

Ming Zun was naturally aware of what all of them were thinking, and he transmitted his voice to everyone.

"Rest assured, fellow daoists; if it turns out that we're no match for this true immortal, then I won't force any of you to stay here. However, don't forget about Fellow Daoist Xuan Jiuling. All we need to do is create a good opportunity for Brother Xuan to strike, and there's a very good chance that he'll be able to kill this true immortal."

Everyone's hearts stirred slightly upon hearing this.

Xuan Jiuling was an extremely renowned powerful being who had slain nine true spirits, and the fact that he was constantly lurking in the shadows instilled everyone with some confidence.

Right at this moment, the golden giant opened its eyes. Its magic power had finally been converted into immortal spiritual power, allowing it to unleash some true immortal secret techniques.

Unbeknownst to his opponents, he wasn't intending to attack them with his spirit domain.

For an immortal, a spirit domain could be used in battle as something similar to a bonded ability, but its main purpose was to assist one in their cultivation. As such, he wasn't planning to use it to directly attack at all.

With that in mind, a cold smile appeared on Ma Liang's face, and he made a grabbing motion toward the river of blood down below.

A burst of loud rumbling rang out, and the river of blood converged to form a massive angular seal.

The seal had crimson flames burning all around it, and there were countless images of different creatures etched onto its surface.

All of these images were extremely life-like, as if they were living beings, and they presented a very unsettling sight to behold

This was none other than the Myriad Spirit Blood Seal, which had finally been successfully refined after countless living beings had been sacrificed.

With his immortal spiritual power, Ma Ling was now able to unleash most of the treasure's power, and even if he had to kill an ordinary true immortal, it would be a simple task for him.

As such, it was complete overkill to be using this seal on opponents of such a lowly caliber, and he was expending a lot of essential power, but he had no choice if he wanted to end this battle immediately and ensure that none of his opponents escaped.

With that in mind, Ma Liang injected most of his immortal spiritual power into the giant seal in a frenzy before hurling it through the air.

All of a sudden, the crimson seal vanished amid a rumbling boom, and in the next instant, a cloud of blood mist emerged above the black light formation amid a burst of violent spatial fluctuations.

A gargantuan crimson seal then appeared within the mist, and all of the images on its surface were manifested as projections.

The massive seal began to slowly descend from above, and the space down below began to tremor and warp violently.

The black light formation was also twisted by the seal's power, and the 81 black crystal balls within it exploded one after another.

As a result, the black light formation instantly vanished, much to the astonishment of Ming Zun and the others, who were preparing to attack.

"Run!" someone yelled, and everyone immediately fled as streaks of light in different directions, but they only made it several hundred feet before an earth-shattering boom rang out up above.

A burst of tremendous power suddenly descended upon the space within a radius of hundreds of kilometers, forcing the streaks of light to plummet out of the heavens and revert back to their original forms.

Thus, all of the Grand Ascension Stage beings were forced to reappear, and all of them wore horrified expressions.
